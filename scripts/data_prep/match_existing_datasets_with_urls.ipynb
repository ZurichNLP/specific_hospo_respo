      "1079279 Valentines stay ---SEP--- We chose this location as it’s a short walk away from one of our favourite restaurants- peace and loaf. Parking was simple, check in was quick. We booked a superior room.. The room was quite large, the bed was huge. The only issue I had was when we first walked in there appeared to be a sewer problem..we opened the windows for a short while and the smell disappeared. Nice touch to have kit kats and free drink if your a member. Would definitely recommend and stay again https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186394-d1974359-r657010061-Holiday_Inn_Newcastle_Jesmond-Newcastle_upon_Tyne_Tyne_and_Wear_England.html\n",

I have frequented the west coast very often for the past few years, however, none of my experiences altogether add up to my two night stay at this lodge. Not only are the accommodations beyond outstanding, but the restaurant and bar serve the best food and drink I have ever had. My company and I stayed in one of the cabins and never wanted to leave the second we walked through the door. Big thank you to Samantha and John for making our stay personable and unique to us. They were the happiest people I have ever met and truly passionate about their work and love of the west coast. Everything we asked for was accommodated, including a wonderful boat ride and day spent at the hot springs. Josh, our captain, was extremely knowledgeable, courteous and friendly with hilarious stories. I will never forget this experience, it was the best holiday of my life thanks to the wonderful staff at LBL. When in doubt.... STAY HERE!!!! :) https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g154942-d254778-r249194705-Long_Beach_Lodge_Resort-Tofino_Clayoquot_Sound_Alberni_Clayoquot_Regional_Distric.html\n",

When we checked in to the hotel even though our group leader clarified that it was going to be one bill for the group. They asked our credit card for each room guest and they charged it before the end of our stay. Our group leader visited the accounting several time. Giving his credit card etc. but They didn't correct it. Plus they charged from one of our friends credit card for the second time. We had ocean view rooms. It was beautiful and nostalgic. Breakfast was not open buffet. And yes the lobby smells humidity because of the ocean. Except the accounting problem we enjoyed our stay as a couple. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d80483-r358047197-Pelican_Grand_Beach_Resort_A_Noble_House_Resort-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Flor.html\n",

We stayed 2 nights in a ground floor apartment and our daughter and her friend had their room next to us. Lovely and clean and super comfortable beds. Our daughter enjoyed the convenience of the gym and later that evening we all enjoyed the lovely buffet meal in the restaurant attached to the hotel.

      "264739 A Brilliant mid - week stay ---SEP--- We stayed in The Temple Bar Hotel at the end of April and we had a wonderful time. The hotel is so handy to all the attractions in the City, and it is very welcoming. The staff are friendly and we saw only smiling faces for our total stay. The food was excellent and there was loads of choices for the breakfast menu. It was great value. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends, and we wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else now when we return to Dublin. Thank you to all the staff for making our trip so memorable. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214554-r106238874-Temple_Bar_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html\n",
      "271493 The Grand is Grand ---SEP--- How can people on here say it's old and tired. I don't get that at all! You must be very young and like modern hi-tec buildings. Yes it's old but charming but certainly not tired! It has ambience and character! And a great bar! You really feel like you're staying in a proper old hotel like in the movies. The staff are fantastic. Go to a cold mordern hotel if it's not for you. Have you tried next door...The Hilton. YUK! I am a very well travelled person. I love my five star luxury and I love attentive staff and great service. You get all of that here. We did have a sea view room... Worth it if you want a romantic pampered weekend away but you can get some good deals. Dinner and breakfast fantastic but try Riddle and Finns for the most fantastic fish restaurant with it candelabras on the tables. You can't book but go and tell them you want a table, head off for a drink or two and he'll call you when your table is ready. Staying at the grand, dinner at the Riddle and Finns. It doesn't get much better in Brighton! Love it! https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186273-d192203-r126824828-The_Grand_Brighton-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html\n",

Their extensive Italian menu is second to none including some amazing flat-bread pizzas. My go-to is their Chicken and Asiago Salad. You won't find a better salad anywhere (believe me, I've tried). One unique characteristic of Pacini is their all-you-can-eat bread pantry with various types of bread and 6-7 different types of butter. You then grill your own bread right right there in the restaurant and then take it to your table. The service is always amazing from the manager down to their servers. When I go there, I try to sit in Tracy's section. Her cheerful attitude and professionalism will definitely keep you coming back. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g154913-d1760424-r639462054-Pacini_Calgary-Calgary_Alberta.html\n",

      "2370236 Nice room, frustrating weekend ---SEP--- My husband and I had a weekend away in Wollongong and chose to stay in an executive suite in the Chifley Hotel. We stay at a lot of four to five star hotels and the Chifley really didn't inspire us to stay there again. The room was large and had a view of the ocean. Sleep quality was excellent. The bathroom was huge with the biggest and deepest bathtube I've ever had the pleasure of using. It was fortunate we had a bathtube because as another reviewer has commented, there was no cold water available on Fri 23 Sep evening, and we were told the whole hotel was affected. An hour after asking reception for assistance, two staff members came with a tub of cold water to fill the bathtub. It worked but the tub water wasn't completely clean and left a residue in the tub. No compensation was offered. The next night there was a mysterious vibrating noise coming into our room from around 9.30pm to 10.15pm. Thankfully it stopped after a while but I was left thinking- oh no, something's gone wrong again with this place. Also because of an unforeseen road closure, the hotel could only be accessed through a public carpark or through a dark residential road. I felt very bad for the wedding party that I watched trudge through the car park in the wind and rain. Buffet breakfast on Sunday was disappointing - the skim milk had a strange taste so I couldn't drink it and the quality of the rest of the food seemed second rate. Choice was poor when compared to other hotel buffet breakfasts we have had. $28 per person is an expected price to pay but the quality and choice should have been better. Our overall experience was average to poor and we won't be coming back. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255333-d1777482-r118760061-Sage_Hotel_Wollongong-Wollongong_New_South_Wales.html\n",

We queried, were told then they didn't do it by the glass (they did). To be fair, it was good when it finally arrived. Strongly suspect our burgers went to the next table only to be returned. They weren't bad, tho could have been warmer. Chips good, as was sticky toffee pudding. Bill when it came was wrong, with added drinks. We asked for the service charge to be removed - the service was offhand and perfunctory. On top of all that, the faux and clichéd Scots theming is verging on the offensive. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d11855160-r635442177-Mac_Wild-London_England.html\n",

Last but not least, the location was perfect for what we needed. Just a couple of blocks from Waikiki beach and so many other attractions within walking distance, we didn't even need a rental car. There is a bus stop in front that makes getting around the island convenient and affordable.

The waitress was great but my wife sitting watching the chef saw one chef eating what he was preparing, then put his fingers from his mouth back into the food. He did this many times not a good look or hygenic for a 5 star resturaunt.

      "2660427 Traditional English Hotel ---SEP--- I stayed at the Hermitage for 2 nights and it was lovely. It's a really traditional English hotel. The size of the room was alright and the bed was comfortable. The toilet was spacious too. The basic amenities of a kettle and snacks were available as well. Service was average. Something that I found interesting was that they are so traditional that the room keys had a huge plastic tag to it and you've to place your room keys at the reception before leaving (because if you lose the key, you'll have to pay a penalty). The weird thing was when we returned to the hotel to get our room key, no ID was required from us and we could just tell the receptionist our room number and got our keys. Whilst I appreciate the efficiency, I worry about the safety of doing this. Apart from that, the hotel had a basic breakfast buffet that consists of the usual English breakfast components. The hotel was close by to the Bournemouth Pier, which was beautiful. It was also around a 10 minute walk to the shopping arcade. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186262-d282866-r626760378-The_Hermitage_Hotel_Bournemouth-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html\n",
      "482983 Exceptional ---SEP--- Wonderfully warm and rustic setting - exactly what one would want in the oldest part of the city. Service was eager to please, maybe almost too much so. Admittedly, we ate like pigs. The menu was so attractive we aimed to taste more than what we normally would order but all plates went back empty nonetheless. My wife had the tagliatelle dish with mushrooms and thought it was one of the tastiest dishes she's ever had. We also had the tomato and goat cheese apps, the lobster entree and also side dishes of beans and sagamite. This was our first time having sagamite, it was like cream of wheat meets creamed corn & chicken broth. Tasty dish but we weren't sure what to do with it. Too thick/not enough texture for a soup so we dipped our bread in there until we couldn't fit any more. I would typically not order lobster anywhere other than places that are known for it, but I did out of the faith their menu gave me. The sauce and concept were both great but it was unfortunately overcooked. The apologetic squash blossom we were served when they sensed service was lagging on a Saturday night lacked flavor but it was a nice gesture. It was appreciated and was a great idea nonetheless. For what it's worth, we didn't feel service was lagging. We were prepared to go back for breakfast the following morning but felt we owed it to Le Lapin Saute. Next time in QC, we will be back for sure. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155033-d707663-r524749235-Chez_Muffy-Quebec_City_Quebec.html\n",

The food was excellent, and shockingly well priced. We were early enough for the early bird menu as we had a 4 year old with us and needed to eat early.

The bar area With its log fires was so welcoming on a cold night. Look for Callum one of the friendliest efficient and energetic bartenders you will find anywhere who mixes a mean cocktail. Then venture in to the restaurant where the unobtrusive professional service provided by Estelle will enhance your meal. The food was fresh and well cooked with a good range but the prices are a bit steep and that definitely applies to the wine list. All of the staff were well trained and exceptionally helpful.

      "3278850 Elegant and enjoyable ---SEP--- This was probably our 3rd or 4th visit over the number of years and this place does not disappoint especially the views. We were on set menus and though we were not awed by the choice of dishes or the (inexpensive) ingredients, the food was so beautifully cooked and presented and the sauces were so yummy that we ate every scrap of food (admittedly the portions were quite small). We even (rather embarrassingly) asked for more bread that we could mop up the delicious sauces. There was a complementary amuse bouche and some more complimentary marshmallows at the end. The service was very swish and elegant, offering more bread and making sure we truly enjoy our meal (though topping up our wine glasses without checking if it was OK was a bit overzealous; two of us were driving and therefore only wanted a glass of wine but ended up having it poured into our glasses before we could react. So note waiters and sommeliers - please check before you top up someone's glass! One very nice touch we were impressed with, was to give guests some postcards with the views from the restaurant and then offer to post them free of charge anywhere in the world. The only thing that slightly spoilt our experience and was a bit annoying was that such a smart restaurant with pretty solemn dining atmosphere decided to seat a young Russian family with 2 toddlers a couple of tables away from us. Though the young girls were not hugely disruptive and did not make too much noise, we thought that letting children as young as that in during an evening meal was not appropriate. Not sure what their child policy is but this did not strike me as a place where kids under 5 or even 12 should be allowed at night time. Nevertheless, a very enjoyable meal overlooking London. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d730159-r531911782-Galvin_at_Windows_Restaurant-London_England.html\n",

      "1691066 An Oldy but a Goody! ---SEP--- As a local, I remember with great excitement, the Opening of the then Manly Pacific Hotel. The most glamorous spot on the Northern Beaches back in 1982. I've performed at a few events here and we also spent our Wedding Night here way back in 1987! Fast forward several years...and we're back again for a little R and R. Sure, the hotel decor is a little dated...and I'm not sure the foyer looks as glam as it did back then...but once you're shown to your Ocean Front room, swing back that curtain and open the door to your private balcony...It doesn't get any better! Our magnificent Manly Beach at your doorstep, and smack in the middle of all the bars, shops and eateries you could ask for. We doubled our luck by staying over the October long weekend, which of course....means the legendary Manly Jazz Festival. What a weekend. The standard of jazz bands on 6 different stages throughout Manly, plus bands in every pub, made it one of the best weekends we've had. As well as the SUPERB location, one of the most outstanding points of staying at this beautiful hotel is the incredibly friendly, efficient and thoroughly helpful staff! Honestly, every single staff member we've encountered, could not have been cheerier or more willing to help you out with whatever you need. In this day and age of 'non service'...truly great service, determines where I shop, eat and stay. The service from every staff member at the Novotel Manly is OUTSTANDING! A special shout out to a terrific young man Lincoln on Reception. Our 2nd night in, and our car battery died whilst parked across the road from the hotel. Immediately he said he'd do everything he could to help, and with that, he brought out a Battery Charge Pack, headed to our car and fixed the problem immediately. As we then had to drive around for 30 mins to charge the battery, the hotel carpark was then closed. 'No problem' said Lincoln.

      "806879 Good food , inattentative service ---SEP--- The food - I had the scallop appetizer which was excellent. There were three pieces of medium sized scallops on the dish , with chunks of bacon (nice touch!) on top of some purée. The scallops were cooked just perfectly. For the main course , I had the beef sirloin. The meat tasted fine, but I thought it was a little over cooked (I ordered it medium well, and there was not much pink left ) and underseasoned. The trio of chocolate desert was divine. The location - about 5 min walk away from the southwark station . The service - slow and inattentative. Server never came back to check on customers after food was ordered . I had to hunt down the server to get some salt and pepper, and then I had to hunt down server again to get second glass of wine. Overall, i would recommend the food at dinner here , but beware of the substandard service... https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d8833735-r566015135-OXBO_Bankside-London_England.html\n",
      "2693760 Oustanding service and cuisine - not to be missed ---SEP--- After a less than satisfactory visit in the summer, I returned with family for an autumn lunch which we all enjoyed immensely. This first floor restaurant over a Conran shop has been very cleverly designed to offset the slightly odd effect of a rather narrow and long room. There are huge windows overlooking a still leafy school grounds, plenty of roof-lights to let in the midday sun and well-positioned mirrors to enhance the feeling of spaciousness. We were greeted warmly by all the staff and seated at a perfect round table by a window. The Sommelier was first class and soon introduced to a chilled, sparkling Chandon produced in Argentina by methode champenoise and it was utterly delicious. Later he produced Folle Blanche - a traditional grape of Armagnac, late harvested and dry which drank well with our mainly fishy starters. With the main course, he selected Castillo de Moro 2017, a perfect fruity red from Syrah grapes. All five at the table thought the food quite exceptional so full marks to the Chef. I started with a wonderfully rich fish soup garnished with toasted croutons, grated cheese and homemade aioili. Frankly this was better than I have had served in Marseille - say no more! For main course, I chose the Braised pork cheek, lentils, pickled cabbage and Madeira jus with sides of new potatoes and broccoli. Very good but I did temptingly eye my son-in-laws superbly presented Roasted partridge breast and confit leg!! Puddings were again brilliantly presented and awesome to eat but I had heard the cheese trolley was a legend - no disappointment for variety, texture and taste. This was as good a lunch as I have enjoyed in London this year - full marks and many thanks to everyone at the Orrery. We most certainly will return https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d731270-r630508443-Orrery-London_England.html\n",

We were able to walk everywhere. Our room was spacious and had a nice view of the lake. The staff was very accommodating and quick bringing items missing from our room. The decor is outdated but we heard that there are going to be renovations. Hopefully that is true. I was surprised at how few towels were supplied. 1 hand towel and 1 facecloth for 2 people isn't enough. (Ample bath towels though) The bathrobes are a nice touch. (Ours weren't in the room so we had to ask for them).. We didn't realize there wasn't a fridge in the room but they quickly brought one to us. The valet parking is pricy but for downtown Toronto, not surprising. We didn't try the breakfast as there is a Tim Hortons right across the street. The later checkout was nice if you want to stick around and walk along the lakefront. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d183090-r463350693-The_Westin_Harbour_Castle_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html\n",

Quality tea and coffee (always important!) Cons: 1. Rooms are along an outside walkway meaning there is a lot of foot traffic walking past at all hours. This is super noisy making sleep difficult. 2. People can see into your room as they walk past unless you have the thick curtains drawn causing darkness. This made working in the day time impossible without people looking into my room.

So glad we picked here - it may be right round the corner from the city centre but it is peaceful and you will get a great night's sleep. Alongside the fabulous rooms, what makes this hotel is the staff. Never received a more friendly welcome - felt like we were the only guests. The hotel is very nice inside with very modern decor and two restaurants - one fine dining, one gastro-pub style food, very nice! Rooms are so spacious and has everything you need and more. Had only a small issue with the safe, which was resolved in seconds by someone coming up to the room to fix as quick as we had put the phone down. Great customer service. Hotel is a 2 minute walk from the station, 15 minutes walk from the Guinness storehouse and you have access to everything you need practically around the corner.

      "2490122 destination without sophistication ---SEP--- Upon arrival a uniformed doorman opened my partner’s door of the taxi but made no further attempt to help us. We were not offered assistance with luggage and were cursorily waved in the direction of reception. This was our first visit and the porch and entrance hall was congested by a large wedding party so it would have been useful to have been navigated through that. Instead we were made to feel that we were an inconvenience. Having arrived at 12.45 our priority was lunch but thanks to said wedding the main bar was unavailable, as was the garden beyond. We were dispatched to the Spa Bar, where the terrace had a view of a mini golf course. To quote the hotel website “sea views will take your breath away.” I can confirm that the view of the mini golf course from the terrace of the Spa Bar does not take one’s breath away. Again the wedding had precedence over hotel guests. When later we were able to inspect the grounds freely, we found a nice sea view from the garden to which we had been denied access. Alas, much of the rest of the 250 acres is dominated by an 18-hole “championship” golf course. We should have been warned that this is a place to go for golf, mini golf, swimming pools, a spa, even on our upper floor (where overnight a chid’s buggy was parked in the main corridor) a nail salon; for character, sophistication and elegant surroundings there are other destinations in the area. My partner ordered an omelette for lunch; the ingredients were fine but, not having been cooked properly, it was dry on top. I ordered the mussels and bread. Although this was Cornwall there were no mussels available. I ordered a crab sandwich instead. When it arrived a lady at the next table said, “I had one of those yesterday - all I could taste was mango and mayo: can you taste any crab?” She had a point. Wishing to refill our glasses, we discovered that staff standing nearby were more attentive to each other than to the needs of their customers. A gentleman at the next table advised us that the only way to avoid frustration was to go to the bar oneself. The remainder of our stay confirmed that to be the case. Once able to access our room the telephone didn’t work, the kettle lid didn’t close and one of our packets of complimentary biscuits had been opened, to be robbed of half its content. The sea view from the room was nice enough but by now we had had enough of a supposed four star hotel and headed out elsewhere. One shudders to think what an evening meal here might have been like... Returning around 10.00 pm we found our room to have been turned down. The cushions and pillows had been rearranged and a chocolate plonked on each pillow - I say plonked since there had been no attempt to smooth out the pillows beforehand. I am not worried either way about a turn down service but if you are going to do it, do it properly. To me that vignette sums up our entire experience of the Carlyon Bay Hotel. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g528878-d284092-r218296350-The_Carlyon_Bay-St_Austell_Cornwall_England.html\n",

They were all very helpful,friendly and welcoming.There is excellent parking which is always a bonus. The location is fantastic for the Quayside which is always worth a visit and taxis into the city are not expensive if you would prefer not to do the 15/20 minute walk. The only criticism would be that the rooms, although clean and comfortable, were very warm and it meant sleeping with the window open.Not ideal with a busy road at the front.It would be better to request a room at the back. But it did not ruin our stay and we would go back again. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186394-d1902835-r215628588-Premier_Inn_Newcastle_City_Centre_Millennium_Bridge_Hotel-Newcastle_upon_Tyne_Ty.html\n",

But the \"help\" we received from a congierge was another story. Don't fall for their free \"upgrades\".The pictures of the room we booked showed a nice modern room. We asked if we could get a room with a porch and were told yes.I asked if it was new and it was made to sound like it was. We got there the room was ancient the carpet was torn and there was public hair on the bathroom floor. We requested our original room and we were told by the front desk that they have no rooms available. We then spoke to the original person who misled us who proceeded to blame the suite owners on the mess even though we explicitly asked if it was cleaned by hotel staff. He then found us another room that was cleaner but still had the same old look .It was convenient to be able to park right near our room.The next morning I was ready to get out and there were no coffee cups in the room. Its a pity they feel that it's okay to deceive guest . I've never had such a bad experience from a hotel staffer and at a whaldorf no less. He was supposed to help not mislead guests. There are to many nice places around the area for there to be any reason to risk staying here.

      "1675864 Average hotel ---SEP--- The best part about this hotel is the location, but some aspects of it need updating. THe rooms were clean, but the bedding & blankets needed replaced- We did not even use the blanket because it was very worn, pilled and thin. The in room coffee offered cheap cream & sugar options that had no taste and added little to the usual average cup of morning coffee in your hotel room. The room service menu for kids definitely needs more options, especially since the location of this hotel tends to draw families with athletes competing at the convention center. There were only 6 options available and none of them were what I consider to be appealing to the average 10 year old. Plenty of restaurants near by to have other options, but we returned to the hotel late After a competition & just wanted to relax & have dinner in the room, so we ended up having to order pizza as an alternative to the hotel options which was fine. Also did not like that there is no electronic checkout from your room or ability to use your room key to gain access to the skywalk after 11PM. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d88186-r455842020-The_Westin_Indianapolis-Indianapolis_Indiana.html\n",

It was a beautiful setting - ceremony in the gardens, drinks and games on the lawns, reception in a marquee under fairy lights and dancing under the stars. The staff, led by the wedding coordinator Aliesha, were wonderful - they had everything under control, were very knowledgeable and helpful in making suggestions, but at the same time were so calm, patient and accommodating. We loved that we could have all our bridal party staying at the venue and were able to create such an intimate feel by having the whole venue to ourselves. This also meant that we weren't rushed out of the venue at a certain time, which was something we were particularly keen to avoid. We had an absolute ball and all our family and friends have raved about the wedding ever since!

But with the constant stream of hot and hip new fusion this and that opening every month, it tends to be overlooked. But that's a shame because any decent restaurant strip needs an honest bistro. I almost said \"old fashioned\", but it's not. The food is French-ish, without worrying too much about wandering from the classics. The steak is serious and the fish is properly cooked, and if you want the real stuff there's an excellent coq au vin (but please swap the beans for carrots). And there are decent chips. The wine list needs expanding but you still wander between Australia and France - there's even a white burgundy by the glass. It's a cosy room that is at its best in more temperate months.

The food was OK, I have had better Cuban meals in the city. The service wasn't good at all. We ordered an appetizer which came out the exact same time as our meals were served. Even though it wasn't that busy, the waiter didn't stop to make sure we were OK. I was hoping for a bit more salsa and didn't get to ask until my meal was half over. We had to wait a while to receive our check even though it was obvious we were done and the plates were gone. Not sure I would return. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d1536165-r298904423-Havana_Grill-Chicago_Illinois.html\n",

Reception was efficient and friendly, so check in was easy. A short walk to bars, restaurants and into town so this is a great location. There is a good on site laundry which we used to catch up with some washing and drying.

      "3165954 Nice hotel, but... ---SEP--- The Marylebone is a beautiful, quirky hotel with a TERRIFIC location. It is definitely a four-star hotel. Generally, we were very pleased with the quality of service and our accommodations. As expected in an uber-urban hotel, our room was very small, but the appointments were very nice. The front desk staff was responsive, accommodating and professional. However: 1. We had a couple of problems with the room: the light in the coffee service \"counter\" was supposed to go off via a small switch - which didn't work. We ended up opening the closet door so that it would block the light. Secondly, the \"stop\" for the shower door to close was absent. The shower door swung open freely. 2. We paid for the full English breakfast with our room. While restaurant staff greeted us and showed us the buffet, they never prompted us to order off of the hot menu. How many people have restricted themselves to the buffet, not realizing they can also order off of the menu? Those two items aside, this was a good choice for us to be centrally located in London. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d193617-r235147051-The_Marylebone-London_England.html\n",

      "2458860 Do not stay here! ---SEP--- We booked this hotel (on Sunday 23rd July for one night), based on its great location and paid for an exec room. We were given the keys to the Kings Room and were initially happy. Then in the late evening, the person upstairs decided to take a shower and the used water from the shower came flooding into our bathroom. The water was flowing out of an electric ventilator fan, which was still functioning! Water was also pouring on to an electric light. I immediately turned off the switch and called reception. I tried to explain this on the phone and was simply told \"OK we will take the room out of service, come to reception for another room\"? No apology, no interest in the details, if anything was damaged or if we were ok? I thought ok - i will give them the benefit of the doubt, perhaps they are short staffed? I turned up at reception (a guy called Dan I think) was laughing and joking with a female colleague. His reaction to my situation was almost as if he was doing me a favour or I had disturbed him? Again no interest in the details. I explained \"water and electricity is quite dangerous\" - and was met with a blank look on his face? He said he will go and see it later? Imagine if we got electrocuted or if the place burned down? At least he could have written something down for the poor engineer who now has to go into a potentially dangerous room and find out what is going on? No offer was made to help us move our belongings to another room, which turned out to be literally across the other side of the building (only one they had apparently available?) I explained this to the new person on reception the next morning who was slightly apologetic and gave me free parking. Perhaps that was all she could do? Who knows? I think tourism keeps this place artifically alive when it is clearly not being run properly. Take a look at their website, there is no process for making a complaint or contacting anyone to address serious concerns? Good luck - if you choose to stay there... https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186225-d191756-r505526248-Royal_Cambridge_Hotel-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html\n",
      "1664291 Very nice hotel; geared towards adults more than families ---SEP--- My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights last week (in town for a short trip). I'd read some bad reviews of this hotel on other sites but I didn't find anything wrong with the hotel. I've stayed at a W before so knew to expect a modern design. Our room was spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable to me (pillows not so much). We were upgraded at the front desk to a larger balcony room over what we'd reserved. We chose not to have daily maid service (received extra Marriott rewards points for that). The hotel itself was very nice, including pool area and deck. There are windows on the bottom and sides of the pool so you can see people in the pool from the Living Room area below. The beach is right across A1A from the hotel. Parking is valet only and was around $41 but that's what all the hotels in FLL charge. It's an easy walk south to bars/restaurants or north to Hugh Taylor Birch State Park. The only issue with the hotel room layout would be if you are staying in one room with kids, or if you're not staying with a significant other. There is no door to the bathroom area. The shower has frosted glass on the side facing the bed, but the glass is clear facing the vanity. The water closet on the opposite side of the vanity has frosted glass. So if someone is in the shower and someone else needs to use the toilet or sinkwould, the latter person is able to have a full view of the person in the shower. Also, there's no mini fridge so we had no way to keep drinks cold (the mini bar was completely full and we didn't want to move anything for fear of being charged). We didn't dine at the restaurants but the Mexican restaurant on the ground floor (El Vez) was always crowded. I would be happy to stay here again and would've had tacos and margaritas at El Vez if we'd had more time. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d658123-r648015360-W_Fort_Lauderdale-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html\n",

Downside is the walls are thin so you can hear people in the hall and in other rooms. The pillows went flat as soon as my head touched them but they do give you 4 per bed so as long as your not sharing a bed or your partner has no need for pillows you are good and I was disappointed that the towels were small and scratchy. Everything outside the actual room was awesome. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34678-d112455-r343754546-Sheraton_Tampa_Riverwalk_Hotel-Tampa_Florida.html\n",

We weren’t after a meal but I can highly recommend the snacks we had. Started with lassi, which was served in a small tin glass, small but perfectly brewed! Snacks were squid salad, bhindi (okra) bhel, which is puffed rice with spices, Dahi puri, little puffed crispy balls filled with yogurt and spices and chive and garlic prawns, which just the thought of makes my mouth water! For dessert we had kheer and falooda, both of which I highly recommend. We were served by a lovely young student, Poojitha, who was at hand but never in the way. Really smart setting and understandably very popular. If I could change one thing it would be to make the portions a little bigger, hence the mixed feelings. Delicious food but at a price. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d12073042-r648025551-Hankies_Cafe-London_England.html\n",

The gentleman at reception was very pleasant and welcoming. The room was very nice and well designed. Bed and pillows were very comfortable and very quiet. We had an excellent night's sleep.

When we told her about our bad experience the previous time she immediately offered to buy us lunch AND make sure everything was perfect. At first we declined but she was persistent wanting us to be \"happy customers.\" I can tell you she made our day and returned to our table repeatedly to \"check\" on us.

The free mini bar stocked with Tiger beers, Diet Coke, Fanta, bottled water and Sprite was a good touch. We were delighted with the turn down service - you come back from dinner to find classical music playing softly on the Roberts DAB radio and the bins emptied and sheets turned down. A couple of issues - I have been all over the world and have never been asked for my passport at check in, which really put a dampener on things because we had gone up from London where we were born and raised and as far as I’m aware, you don’t need a passport to travel in your own country. Luckily my friend had her driving license which they accepted. Also, be warned that you have to give £100 deposit when you check in which they say they will refund when you leave. We are checking to ensure my friend has this returned to her. Other than that, all was fine and the helpful concierges were one of the high points. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186370-d5272156-r748091673-The_Gainsborough_Bath_Spa-Bath_Somerset_England.html\n",

      "2599622 Not convinced by the Roxy ---SEP--- I booked this hotel for a stay with my teenage daughter. I wanted a room with 2 beds which was surprisingly hard to find in a nice hotel downtown. The Roxy had twin rooms - and great reviews. For me there were too many negatives to want to stay again. Starting with the pros: - very comfortable bed, which is after all important. - staff interactions were positive The cons: - The room has 2 beds and claims to sleep 4. Not only would the room be tiny for that, the beds themselves are big singles - not really doubles. We were 2 - so it worked for us. - At $400 a night, if you forget your toothbrush the hotel would normally give you one. This is entirely monetised via the minibar. $10 for a toothbrush. - The bathroom floor would have shamed a Motel 6 (see the photo). No bathroom flooring should be this stained. - Breakfast was included in the rate but it is highly restrictive, and no allowance is given against the wider menu. I didn't really want Tropicana, awful coffee and a croissant. The paid breakfast menu was excellent. Lesson - don't take inclusive breakfast. - The resort fee (or All Access Fee). I don't want to get into the argument of the ethics of these fees. However, if you do charge the fee, and claim on your website that it is for 'premium wifi', you system you show that. When you log in with your room number, you are told you will only get basic speed capped (5mbps!) unless you pay. Is this in the access fee, or not??? Will you pay 2x. A mess. - we stayed on a Monday night. It felt soulless. I must admit that during the following day, the lobby scene was more interesting. Perhaps the whole vibe of the place was missing on our visit. I could have stayed at the Dominick nearby for the same price (and have stayed there before). The room would have been 2x the size, with huge beds, a pool etc etc. However, they don't have twin bedded rooms. For the benefit of twin beds, you lose a lot at the Roxy. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d208455-r696191050-The_Roxy_Hotel_Tribeca-New_York_City_New_York.html\n",

Our party were seated quite privately towards the back of the dining area which gave that extra special occasion feel. Our rooms were not in the main part of the hotel but this was to our advantage as we found it to be a little more exclusive. On arrival I found I had been given a complimentary room upgrade which was lovely and spacious and had a most comfortable and huge bed. There was also a small box of chocolates and birthday card in my room adding that extra touch. At the end of the evening my daughter realised that she had forgotten my youngest grandsons sleep nappy’s and one of the staff had no hesitation in driving to a convenience store and fetching her a packet.

Our one day fishing had us all landing some squid (which Steve cooked up for us that evening!) and a nice haul of 16 whiting (which gave us a couple of delicious meals). Steve has a great manner and is a relaxed but informative guide.

Lovely old hotel in an ideal location right on the seafront road, fronting The Lanes. Check in was easy with the friendliest of staff and even though we had arrived early, our room was ready enabling us to enjoy a cold but glorious day. The hallways/corridors of the hotel were a bit tatty and tired but I understand that it is being refurbished and the reception/bar/main areas were neat and tastefully decorated. Old Otis lift to floors but you would still need to use stairs to access some rooms. Our room was lovely, no view (you could pay to upgrade to a sea view.) Bed comfy enough and again nicely decorated. I imagine that it would be noisy if you were on the front but our room was quiet and tucked away on the 2nd floor to the side. Only downside was the bathroom which was FREEZING! Only heating in there was a small heated towel rail which did nothing. It was a cold day but there was no hot water either. We ran it for a while but nothing. We did tell the reception who apologised but we had to make do with a cold shower! Invigorating to say the least. It was soon forgotten over breakfast with a good selection of hot and cold food, cereals, fruit etc. Once again greeted by friendly staff.

      "1823407 Outdated; unprofessional service ---SEP--- My Fiance and I were considering having our wedding here. We spoke with the Wedding coordinator and had set a specific time to meet with her as we were traveling from an hour away and needed to be back for work. We arrived 10 minutes early and informed the receptionist that we were there to meet with said woman. They informed us she was not in yet but to take a seat. We noticed immediately the reception office was extremely dated. We waited and waited for about 20 minutes and asked what was happening. They didn't seem phased by the fact that she was late and said she should be arriving soon. Nobody apologized for the inconvenience. Finally after a half hour one of the staff offered to show us around saying that it was unlike this person to be late. I asked if she was coming from a far distance and the staff replied only 20-25 minutes. The lady finally showed up claiming she had gotten a speeding ticket (normally I'm a pretty laid back individual but since I work on appointments, I normally arrive to work 15 minutes early to prepare. Clearly we were not important enough to considered. The restaurant is beautiful, however, the property is anything to write home about and the manner she dealt with us in basically came off \" we do 60 weddings a year here\" and kind of implied that we were just a dime a dozen. When considering on spending thousands of dollars, it was a slap in the face. The newer rooms and lodges are nice, but again nothing special for the price. Their wedding packages are misleading as well. Definitely left a bad taste in our mouths and I am thankful that we did not choose this location as I have since heard many negative reviews about the facility. Obviously the money being brought in isn't being used to update the property or facilities. I will not be back for any reason.

Check in was a breeze and the staff friendly. Our room was located on the 10th floor and was well kept. We didn’t really have a view of anything except a construction site but that was expected due to the room type booked. We really enjoyed the gym and small outdoor area adjacent to it. The complimentary water bottles available were great too. There is a sauna in each change room at the pool and we were quick to use these daily after long days on our feet. The pool itself was ok though we did find it a little cool. (Note, the pool does not have a disability friendly entrance, as you must use a standard pool ladder for entry and exit. This would hinder my ability to recommend this hotel for a family member who needs this amenity.) Funny note: While relaxing at the pool one day, two staff members managed to accidentally lock themselves out on the adjacent outdoor area. We let them back in and shared a laugh over it the rest of our stay. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d255674-r648947680-Sydney_Harbour_Marriott_Hotel_at_Circular_Quay-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html\n",

This is our son's 4th year at Oxford and we have always coveted a visit here. We were always concerned it was a little too aloof for us. Could we have been further from the truth. It is incredibly welcoming, lovely people and the most beautiful setting. As well as staying over, Emma, Toby and the team helped organise a surprise party for our son's 21st birthday. Truly wonderful. Time was tight and we are heading to London to celebrate next week but couldn't let the actual day go by without recognising it -so invited some of his friends for breakfast. 4 hours sitting chatting and enjoying the beauty of the Pike Room, there was no pressure to leave and the food was stunning. The evening before, Charlie and I ordered some bar snacks -olives and pickled vegetables - wow. The pickled veg are outrageously good. Can't recommend this beautiful hotel enough.

Today we ordered Asopao de Pollo and it was served very watery and the chicken besides having little quantity it seemed as pulled out of a freezer bag of boneless chicken and just dumped in it. Not the real chicken you get for a real Asopao but 3 small white chunks of Perdue frozen chunks. We have eaten here this before and it was generous thick and good chicken. This was real bad and nothing close to a real Asopao.

      "151705 Fantastic Hotel in Beautiful setting ---SEP--- Decided to book this hotel for two nights for our wedding anniversary, we hadn't been away in 15 years. We booked a 'Master Deluxe Room with a Lake View' - as we knew this was in the new part of the building and away from all the husstle & busstle and we wanted everything to be as perfect as possible. Although there were one or two minor things that could be improved on the hotel, I'll leave them till last. Wow, what can I say. Room was magnificent and comfortable, like a home from home - but the view from our balcony was like something out of a fairy-tale! Unbelievable. The staff knew we were staying on our wedding anniversary so had sprinkled rose petals all over the bed and jacuzzi. They also left a few chocolates, all which was a lovely kind touch. The room was spacious and airy, two sinks in a lovely modern bathroom with a decent sized shower. Wardrobe with plenty of mirrors, kettle, Iron, ironing Board, safe, Fridge cooler, Kettle, Hair dryer, and literally anything else that you might need. The living area featured a flatscreen TV with two comfortable chairs with footstools and a bowl of fresh fruit accompanied with bottled water. The jacuzzi bath in the corner of the room nearest the window was the best feature - you could lay and relax in the tub whilst watching the sun set over Carrauntoohil - and the fact that you were not on the ground floor meant you had privacy from outside. We've stayed in 4-star joints before, but many barely scrape 4 stars if theyre lucky - the Lake Hotel is definitely a 4-star PLUS. The food was delicious in both the Bar and the Restaurant - we ate in the Bar on both nights, as what was the point going elsewhere when we could look out at such a beautiful view. We drove the Gap of Dunloe on the first evening - left hotel about 4pm and got back just before dark (end of september - dark at 7pm). All the walkers, cyclists and jaunting carts were well gone at that stage and we had the gap to ourselves, as we entered from the South side (Black valley). Allow about 2.5hrs from hotel to hotel. Some previous reviews said it was a hairy drive, extremely dangerous etc., so we traveled with caution - however it turned out not to be? There was ample room on the road and somewhere to pull in every 100yards or so... (If your from Ireland, it would be the same as a normal road in Connemara or crossing the Sally Gap in the Dublin Mountains - nothing too extreme at all. Probably just something the Americans are not used to). That hour of the evening we only met about 5 cars in the 2.5hrs. The Ring of Kerry was beautiful, as was Valentia Island & the Skelligs. Back to the Hotel - well we couldn't fault it whatsoever. We overheard the barman telling someone to watch out for deer out on the back lawn after dark - we thought he was pulling their leg, until 15mins later we saw a pair of antlers passing the window as we ate desert!. By the time we got outside, they had bolted - however we had great views of their antics from the balcony of our room for the rest of the evening, creeping along past the windows to get to the other side of the lake. Still can't get over how beautiful this Hotel and view is and I would highly recommend it. The only negatives (and I'm struggling to find any), are three things; 1.) Staff. Some of the Breakfast staff could be a little friendlier. We were never asked during breakfast if everything was ok, or saw anyone smile. We could have done with a coffee top-up one morning. The Barmen on the otherhand were delightful, Receptionists friendly & welcoming, and the Room staff/Cleaners seemed to be the friendliest of all - we met them each morning on the corridors and would always say hello, or have a chat about something and let you ahead of them in the lift. Its a pity the breakfast staff didn't do the same course as the others. 2.) The Television. Two of the channels on the TV were devoted to the Ring of Kerry. This was a good idea and very handy, as we watched it the night we arrived and it ensured we missed nothing the following day. It showed footage of all the sites with music in the background. Unfortunately the lack of, and quality of the stations was very fuzzy (far from HD TV) and the sound was a bit distorted on some channels. We didn't mind too much though, as we didn't go to Kerry to watch TV!! - but may have been an issue if we had kids with us? 3.) External Appearance. The external appearance of the Hotel could do with a bit of work. The Reception block (which is the oldest part of the building) needs a lick of fresh paint outside. Also there is a section of building between reception and the Delivery entrance, which looks near-derelict and like the windows are about to fall out. Its a pity, as the hotel is beautiful inside. If this part is unused, maybe it should be overgrown with shrubbery or blocked up because it really lets down the appearance. Finally the 'yard' where deliveries go, which I also think is the kitchen rear entrance, looks terrible from the carpark. Maybe put up large gates, or a staggered screen so it is not visible to guests. The reason I highlight these external issues, is this - we spent some time during our stay driving into some of the other hotels in the locality, to see if they were nice or not, and if there was somewhere we might like to try on our next visit. We were turned off by some purely by their outside appearance - so it might be an idea to look at this. Yes, there was ground maintenance also ongoing, but it would be unfair to comment on that as it is out of season, which I completely understand. All in all, a fantastic hotel and I would highly recommend to anyone! https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186612-d212584-r424971910-The_Lake_Hotel-Killarney_County_Kerry.html\n",

To compensate, he interrupted our ordering by doing his sales routine in a forward way. As this was my first encounter with Cuban cuisine, I cannot assess the kitchen properly.

Staff were very welcoming and friendly upon our arrival. Beds were huge and nicely presented, had a great sleep as a result. Considering it is so near pubs and bars, our stay remained so peaceful with beautiful views of Leeds Minster which is certainly very fitting for the theme of the serviced apartments. The car park that is offered is only a 4 minute walk to the apartments and is locked after 11pm at night so felt very secure. Perhaps one criticism would be the lighting. While it creates a certain ambiance within the apartment, it proved to be a little to dark to apply make-up well in the morning. However, this wasn't a huge deal, just something to bear in mind.

      "3280506 Worst experience ever! ---SEP--- Why did you call it Mantra? We have stayed in this hotel more than a couple of times & yet this experience is the worst one! We paid $322 per night for a single room including breakfast-stayed Room 160B .The room was fairly clean but don't see any reason why tagged with that much price, no view or balcony. Since it was over eastern break we don't have a choice except agreed to be ribbed off. Bedsheets has stains & not well maintained. Bedsheets are to be change every third days if you need to change them prior due date there is price list how much to be paid for each items you want to have change. There is no explanation why they are doing that? We called room service and ordered dinner for both of us which delivered in two takeaway box. I am not sure but assume their excuse may will be to go green, concerning about the environment, if so, under the name of green robbery is taking place in daylight. Everything is about cutting cost and more profit to the hotel nothing goes to the customers. The breakfast is beyond our expectation, my wife wanted to have French toast but they are not willing to do that except suggesting to use what's on the buffet but we have seen them doing pouch egg for someone. Though we paid we decide to have breakfast somewhere and found across the road a decent breakfast for $12. We order in house movie at the price of $9.95, couldn't watch it due to weak Internet connection, called the reception and informed the situation but there wasn't a callback until I finally callback myself half an hour later which to be informed he was over the phone all this time talking to the service provider to rectify the problem. The problem couldn't be resolved and we didn't watch the movie, what a joke. The service and the price we paid are no where to match, we don't recommend Mantra Lorne at all specially over holiday season. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g261659-d488643-r359238595-Mantra_Lorne-Lorne_Victoria.html\n",

      "2501769 Stunning house but beware of the owner ---SEP--- Bohdi House is stunning and made for the perfect location for a surprise Hen weekend. The house alone would score an unquestionable 5 star rating. It is really spacious, tastefully done out and has everything you need. For a group of 15 it was perfect. BUT, beware of the owner. She double booked us then tried to blame my friend who dealt with the booking, despite having taken a deposit. She made out she was pretty relaxed about this and that when we checked in but then made a big fuss over a curry stain on the table cloth and broken glass in the bin after we checked out, including taking extra money out of the deposit for the fact broken glass was put in the bin (not for the actual glass which she was cool about us having accidentally broken). Where else were we supposed to put it??!! This house is stunning but if you don't want the hassle of the owner when booking the entire house for a weekend then find another, there must be plenty of similar properties in Bath. We were NOT a rowdy drunken group who left the place in a complete mess so it's a shame the owner had this attitude after we left. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186370-d1209441-r352438646-Bodhi_House-Bath_Somerset_England.html\n",
      "1847638 Great Hotel ---SEP--- First time to New Plymouth and so really didn't know what to expect. The Hotel is modern and bright and although not large had all the facilities that I needed. Great friendly staff on reception who really made an effort everytime I dealt with them. Easy check in and I had a great room which was larger than most I have stayed in. Meals were very good except breakfast where I encountered a chaffing dish fiull of over cooked and dry scrambled eggs. Would be far better if they could cook eggs to order instead of cooking eggs in bulk. Overall it was a great stay and would stay there again if I was ever in New Plymouth. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255112-d8772776-r473959012-Novotel_New_Plymouth_Hobson-New_Plymouth_Taranaki_Region_North_Island.html\n",

We checked in and the staff were all polite and helpful. The room was quaint and had all the basics you expect. We went to the health spa for a swim and a jacuzzi and were disappointed at what we found. The pool was small which was ok. What wasn't ok was the colour of the water and the tiles on the waterline. They were black and scummy looking. The water was a greeny colour which I don't know if it was suppose to be. If it was then I apologise. The sauna, steam room and outdoor hot tub were all fine. Once we had changed we went down to dinner. Again the staff were attentive and polite. The food, which included a chilli jam mussel crab cake, a cod dish (with soggy skin), a trout mousse (with a small bone in it) and a stodgy cheesecake, was just nice and nothing more or less. There weren't fireworks which you would expect from a taster menu. Breakfast the next day was lovely and my fried breakfast was hot and tasty! So to sum up, I would say for a reduced cost Groupon deal it was worth it. I wouldn't though pay the actual price for this experience that the hotel would charge. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g660735-d210858-r171472686-Chevin_Country_Park_Hotel_Spa-Otley_Leeds_West_Yorkshire_England.html\n",

The designers of this restaurant did everything to ensure you have a relaxing, elegant dining experience, and the chef and wait staff do the rest. There are many, many small details that make this place great, from the fresh flowers on the table, to the gold flatware, to the beautiful linens and handsome waiters. (I don't know how they got so many good-looking people to apply as wait staff, but I'm glad they did.) More importantly, the food is beautiful. Served with a flair for pleasing the eye almost as much as the palette, the food is outstanding. We asked the chef to bring whatever he wanted, and enjoyed a feast of so many different flavors and textures I can't begin to do them justice. The bar scene is vibrant but not loud or crowded, and the dining room hits the right notes between cozy, sophisticated, and comfortable. Highly recommended for any special occasion, an after-work drink, or a weekend brunch. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32070-d10061655-r387237787-Avec_Nous-Beverly_Hills_California.html\n",

      "3210893 Worst experience so far...please give this restaurant a miss ---SEP--- We just had Christmas lunch at this restaurant. I can confidently say that this was our worst experience of all the high end Indian restaurants. Food was average and staff (managers etc. didn't understand basics of customer service). Set meal was £125 per person but the food was below average. My local Indian restaurant serves better food for £25. I had 'Salmon carpaccio with caramel Jhal muri'. It tasted ok but not something I expected to eat in an expensive restaurant. My partner had 'mini pancakes (uttapam) with coconut chutney'. The presentation of this dish was worse than a street vendor. My partner said that the pancakes and the main course (kofte) tasted stale. I had king prawns. Prawns had nice flavour but I had to eat lot of gritty sand with it. Side dishes were average too. Interim course was great. We gave this feedback to the waiter. 'Mr Harsh Joshi' (Manager) came and spoke with us. He gave us his card. He told us to email him later and promised to look after us in the future. We were disappointed with his response and hoping that he would have tried harder to rectify the situation. We were presented with the final bill with no further discussion or consideration. We asked to speak to the manager hoping our bad experience would be reflected in the final bill. We waited for almost 30 mins but it appeared that staff were avoiding to speak with us. I think they were hoping that we would pay and leave quietly. Finally we decided to get up and speak with them. Another gentleman told to us to either pay in full or leave without paying anything at all. There was no attempt made to acknowledge our experience and turn it into a positive customer experience by offering something in return. The promise of 'looking after us next time' gave us no confidence at all. I have eaten here before and have always recommended it to my friends and colleagues. It appears that this restaurant has become complacent and does not care any longer if it's customers are happy or not. Quality of food is not good either. I am sure my review wouldn't necessarily stop people eating at this restaurant. At least I would not recommend it to anyone. There are so many good high end Indian restaurants in London now that it would be OK to give this place a miss in the future. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d718517-r734596239-Cinnamon_Club-London_England.html\n",

The Jefferson is convenient to I95. Fairly expensive, but a good price for value provided. Every staff member we encountered was courteous, professional, and friendly. Our room--a king deluxe--was lovely, room service elegant, food (crab cakes, pork chops) delicious. (The peanut soup was better than my own, and I've been making and enjoying mine for years.) Lavish Christmas decorations over three lobby levels contributed holiday spirit, and somehow, even though all was bustling and festive, the public areas felt peaceful. Maybe because they are so enormous? The only negative was a too-firm bed, but I'm still giving five stars.

We stayed in a king room with a view, the room was massive, yes a few bits of furniture were dated but this did not spoil a wonderful stay. The staff go above and beyond to help you, we had treatments in the salon, gorgeous and as good as any spa I’ve visited before, yes the health club part and pool could do with a few little bits of attention but pool was lovely and a nice clean sauna area and changing room. We had a sea view room above a main road so I was expecting to hear the sea at night and some traffic noise but it was quieter than I expected despite the overnight storm. Overall a really nice stay, dinner in evening was well cooked, tasted really good and was a reasonable price, we were given vouchers for a complimentary drink each which was a nice surprise! we didn’t stay for breakfast but only because it suited us. Will definitely visit again and probably book direct to get best price and special offers. Yes it’s not modern but the staff and charm of the hotel far outway the little modernising it would benefit from. We parked next door in the lanes car park and used the discount voucher to get 24 hours for £21. For a secure, covered car park close to the town and hotel I was happy with that. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186273-d215490-r669693457-Queens_Hotel-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html\n",

Eventually found a spot to sit. The service wasn't at all customer friendly and I could feel it that I was being treated differently. Anyway, it was late at night and this was my last meal (I had actually saved up this restaurant for my last meal and didn't want to walk away because of some not-so-nice wait-staff.

Chicken tikka, king prawn nobabi, chicken shashlik, and more are amazing. 2. The restaurant is open late than most and will accommodate you with a smile late at night. 3.

Yes the rooms feel a bit cold and clinical (particularly the disabled ones with wet room which on the flip side was abundantly spacious) and it is a good walk into town but if your driving and staying in Glasgow for no more than a couple of nights on a budget then it should meet your needs.

We were told they don't have the supplies for any walk-ins to order those items. It's fun to sniff out and select the tea you'd like as well as selecting a hat to wear. I think they must get a lot of people wanting menu items not available without a reservation because it seemed to give some irritation to the owners.

No reason to go for a second visit with all the other new options at the adjacent \"park\" for T mobile arena. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d7387603-r364275698-Tom_s_Urban-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html\n",

Very busy, although it was December and I think a lot of people having Xmas catch ups with friends and family. Also a 30th, 40th and 80th birthday celebrations happening at other tables. Unfortunately was pouring with rain, however I would imagine the view is actually great of the lake. I believe it is popular on weekends for fish and chips downstairs and then you can sit on the lawn and listen to live entertainment.

      "2201042 Serious need of remodel ---SEP--- Have stayed at this hotel many times over the years, but it is time to find other accomodations in the future. It's also time for the hotel to receive a serious upgrade. Personnel working at the hotel were pleasant, considering the fact that they were working on Christmas Day. But, the facility is showing it's age: poor bedding, heat that could not be adjusted (actually the controls were just plain weird.....something was not working properly), and a toilet repair that I had to make myself. On the positive side: we had plenty of hot water, and the room was located at the quiet end of an upper hallway. The free breakfast was pitiful.....one look was all it took to send us out to a local restaurant. We have enjoyed the indoor pool/hot tub in the past, but the murky water in the hot tub observed during this visit made all thoughts of using it disappear. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55270-d225282-r188805544-Country_Cascades_Waterpark_Resort-Pigeon_Forge_Tennessee.html\n",

The room itself is small, but well designed, and perfectly comfortable for a short stay. The hotel has an easily walkable location in Foggy Bottom, right next to George Washington University Campus. It is within a half mile walk to the Lincoln Memorial in one direction, and only slightly longer to the White House in another direction. The design of the hotel is quirky and fun, and both the Hive Bar and &pizza in the lobby area are excellent. If you don’t need a sprawling room or real closet space, Hive Hotel is highly recommended!

This is a great place as there are many families so our children made lots of friends. The hotel is very spacious so although full there is plenty of space for everyone. The food is good and they do nice extras like tea and Christmas cake in the afternoons. There is a lovely spa but the pool is very small and not suitable for swimming as there are steps all the way across one end. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186239-d191645-r337341397-The_Headland_Hotel_Spa_Newquay-Newquay_Cornwall_England.html\n",
      "198624 Nice Property & Stay ---SEP--- Prior to booking this property, I direct messaged a question to the Facebook account of this hotel as to whether or not they had a pool and hot tub. I got a reply stating that they do not have a pool or hot tub. Upon further checking, this property does indeed have not just one but 2 hot tubs and 2 pools. So, I'm not sure if that is a legitimate account or if the person answering just had no clue. I would hate to see them lose guests because of that. I was glad I checked. This property is older but well kept and very clean! The self-parking area is adjacent and well lit at night. We were upgraded to concierge floor due to my Gold Elite status with Marriott. The lounge was nice and attendants that we encountered were very polite. In fact, all employees that we encountered were very pleasant. Easy access to Dick's Sporting Good Park which was one of the reasons we booked here. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d111562-r685809531-Renaissance_Denver_Stapleton_Hotel-Denver_Colorado.html\n",

Stayed in the Fairmont View room, which was spacious and quiet with a comfortable bed and great view of the city (only complaint would be the small shower -- which is very confining for anyone 6' or above). Fairmont has a cool, trendy (so somewhat expensive) bar located in the lobby -- a perfect spot for a nightcap. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d185747-r537014404-Fairmont_The_Queen_Elizabeth-Montreal_Quebec.html\n",

We were so impressed with the room itself, with a kitchen built in along with 2 double beds and a pull out sofa bed which has a mattress in it? The staff were friendly, and very helpful with extra towels, tea bags etc. One small thing was that the luggage room that they have to hold your bags if you arrive early was completely full - no room what so ever so we had to leave our bags with lots of others on the left hand side of the foyer which can leave you a little uneasy. However out bags were still there when we returned. The other thing is the lighting, its not the greatest for a group of girls to be getting ready in, and the lift had better lighting. Other than that we had an enjoyable stay and would go again. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186337-d8355856-r352035004-The_Shankly_Hotel-Liverpool_Merseyside_England.html\n",

Our function was perfectly set up when we arrived. Had a dedicated waitress who was very patient when people moved seats after ordering meals. The food arrived together which is tricky to do for 40 people and everyone loved their meals. I have given it top score for value, $20 set menu included first drink. I prepaid the food and a numbering system was set up so people could pay individually for their own drinks which worked well.

There were only two of us, but we had four beds, and a sofa. Like all places we stayed, there was no A/C, but it cooled off just fine at night with cool air coming off the lake. It is a nice walk into town. I loved going out to look at the stars at night. It was the perfect place for us in Te Anau. I would stay here again.

      "2018005 Too long to wait between courses, meals not as good as expected ---SEP--- We had a party of 10 booked for a birthday celebration at 1.30pm. Upon arrival, with two disabled in our party, we were kept waiting for at least ten minutes before being shown to our table. Once seated, it took half an hour before our orders were taken. Only three of us ordered starters, but when they arrived, one was missing the dressing that was supposed to be on it. It took another hour before the plates were cleared away and our main courses were brought. The meals were not as good as expected, especially the slow cooked bellow of pork, which was basically a lump of fat on the plate with overcooked veg with it. The desserts took another half hour to arrive after being ordered and again, the mini desserts with coffee were not good. The coffee was only luke warm and the Eton Mess dessert was just cream with a few blueberries. If it had been very busy we could have understood the wait, but there was hardly anyone in there. It took us from 1.30pm to 5pm to be able to finish our meal due to the unacceptable lengths of waiting time between courses and the meals were not up to scratch, especially considering the price paid for them. The staff who served us were friendly and helpful, but service was very, very slow. All in all, we will not be using this establishment again and unfortunately I cannot in all honesty recommend it. We did not complain at the time because we did not want to spoil our elderly family member's birthday celebration, but I feel I must inform others of the problems we encountered. This will be marked down to experience and never used again for our families celebrations. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186334-d3859331-r649939278-Red_Cow-Leicester_Leicestershire_England.html\n",

We were treated to a chocolate souffle in honor of our anniversary, complete with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate around the plate.

It's about a five minute walk from the train station right in central Edinburgh so is perfect location wise. The nearest car park we originally found was pretty far away however and extremely expensive so if you are driving then factor this in to your stay. Apartments are lovely inside and so is the building its self. Well stocked kitchens, smart tv and sofa and bed, everything you need really for your stay except food, they even had little salt and pepper grinders. The only gripe we had is an item of my girlfriends clothes went missing and every time we phone them to complain we speak to a different staff member who doesn't speak perfect English and can't seem to understand what we are talking about. I would usually bring a review down to 1 star for missing items however this place is really nice and deserves better. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186525-d4331658-r332963950-Old_Town_Chambers-Edinburgh_Scotland.html\n",

The cabin was clean, tidy and well appointed. Park was clean and tidy with a small pool, lots of shade, beach is absolutely stunning, would be good to go in non stinger season and come back with our van. The only thing that was disappointing was the welcome I received when I checked in. The manager probably needs to have a think about how she greets people on arrival. It doesn't matter how fabulous the park is, first impressions count and has left me with a not so good lasting memory. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255338-d2534248-r190651275-Mackay_Blacks_Beach_Holiday_Park-Mackay_Queensland.html\n",

The service was all over the shop. The first impressions were bad, four people standing behind the desk as you walk in... The first girl was rude, the others didn't speak, and none were welcoming. We sat at a table and then waited for 30 minutes to place a drink order... At this point I was considering walking out. And I honestly wish we did. We ordered oysters, we were not served our cutlery then proceeded to wait for a waiter to notice us to get these and just to get the basics like and salt & pepper. We were not asked for another drink, and our bill for 6 oysters two drinks and two mains (steak for over $50 and tuna $40 small portion) was $200... Certainly not value for money.

      "2200227 Clean, convenient ---SEP--- Our review is as simple as this hotel: 1-Very clean--common areas very attractive, more so than the rooms; 2-Paid more than $200 for a 2-bedroom suite, even though Busch Gardens not busy; suite was cramped; 3-Furnishings in the suite inexpensive, but we did have a Jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and in the hallway had an area with a small sink, mini fridge, and microwave; 4-Rooms need some basic maintenance 5-Several restaurants very close (Outback and Olive Gardens) 6-Weren't sure how safe the area was, although we had no trouble; there were police cars next door for some time 7-Hotel located close to a busy intersection and on opposite corner to Busch Gardens, but our suite was quiet 8-Beds very comfortable! https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34678-d1138969-r274760939-Holiday_Inn_Express_Suites_Tampa_USF_Busch_Gardens-Tampa_Florida.html\n",
      "2551654 Unusual layout. Pool was awful ---SEP--- The layout of the hotel was a bit bizarre, we had to walk through the restaurant to get to our room. The room itself had a strange layout too but was big, clean & comfortable and the staff were lovely. We used the pool on our second night, the changing rooms were filthy (towels on the floor, old plasters etc) The stream room had dirty seats covered in strange foam cushions & the baby pool was full of sand??? Couldn’t wait to get back to the room to shower (wouldn’t use the showers in the changing rooms 🤢) https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186635-d553661-r608185536-Clayton_Hotel_Sligo-Sligo_County_Sligo_Western_Ireland.html\n",

I had trouble with my plug for the kitchen sink and they swapped it over no problem. Pool was great, pod coffee maker was convenient. Only downside is that the parking is in an adjacent parking station so you can't just get a lift from the parking up to your room with your bags, you need to go through the lobby then get an elevator. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g1234132-d10627738-r484257882-Meriton_Suites_Church_Street_Parramatta-Parramatta_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wa.html\n",

At first we got a room with a window facing the parking lot so we went back down to the desk to see if we could get a room with a different view, the staff was very polite and understanding about this.

I added a large pot of tea so the price with tax came to $42.38. The wifi was either very slow or non existent (I never got on after getting their password and rebooting to see if that was the problem.)

We were seated accordingly, felt good to be seated near the fireplace since it was so cold outside. The restaurant was busy but our food came at a reasonable time. From time to time the server would check on us (which is great). We enjoyed everything on the menu that we partook. The service was impeccable. One thing though, I used the restroom and it seems like it needs a little sprucing. Bathroom tissues were on the floor since the dispenser was broken; the roll would fall off when you pull the sheet/s (unnecessary waste). Would be nice if there's someone who checks on the cleanliness of the restrooms especially when the restaurant is busy. Overall, the experience was nice for everyone including my 2 kids.

Added touches such as the coffee machine, biscuits, pillow spray, bottles of water in the room were massively appreciated. The cooked breakfast was delicious!

      "445818 Superb setting, so much more potential ---SEP--- Most people would think this hotel is above average but at £320 per night - it falls way short of a hotel charging these prices. I can’t fault the room - we stayed in the Coombsgate - it was excellent with a view to match. The hotel let’s itself down on service, lacks any atmosphere and the food was below average. We ate in the Bistro on the first night - it was bland and the quality of the food was average - for example potatoes boiled, quartered and served - no seasoning or imagination. It just seemed very amateur. My 2 biggest bug bears are they do serve coffee with breakfast but if one would like a cappuccino instead they say it is chargeable as an extra. Well, if I am paying £320 per night for a room I expect my choice of coffee to be included! Plus again a hotel at this level should stock bottles or cans of Diet Coke - not just the horrible syphon pump. It really could improve on the customer service. I’ve been taught there always has to be a solution to customers requests - this hotel could learn from that advice. In the evening the lounge/bar area was always empty by 10ish - so as long as you’re happy with that or retiring early - just bear it in mind - maybe it is busier at other times of the year. The staff would benefit in customer interaction skills and some could learn to smile. In fact the reception staff are the only ones who did the above. The hotel lacked any form of atmosphere and I feel the staff contribute a large part to this - the hotel feels soulless. On the plus side their cream teas are on if the best in the area. The facilities and outside areas are excellent. So in conclusion, the hotel, its facilities and the location are excellent - the way it is run and the staff and the management is where the problem lay. I didn’t voice my concerns about the concept coffee and drink on day 2 but no one bothered to address this. Poor customer service. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g551703-d491757-r588313972-Watersmeet_Hotel-Woolacombe_Devon_England.html\n",

We had the opportunity of staying in the Taranaki suite (the largest) of the 3 with a beautiful free standing bath tub and the New York suite. The period home was warm and bright with all the luxurious touches from the lush comfortable beds, fireplaces, New Zealand made bath products, honesty bar with yummy wines,artwork, and the heart that goes into the delicious morning breakfasts.You have all the privacy you would normally have in a hotel suite, except you have Rachel and Rodney who are full of local knowledge if you need it, and you'll be glad you asked. Its a 2 min stroll to Pukekura Park, walking distance to the CBD with loads of little restaurants and bars.

The restaurant didn’t seem overly busy and there seemed to be sufficient waiting staff on duty but they spent a lot of time together at the till. Sandwiches were basic and some of the bread was slightly hard. Coffee was dire and for that treason alone I will not go back.

      "2740290 Little disappointed... ---SEP--- Well. I must say whomever the photographer is who does the images for this resorts marketing deserves photographer of the year. Because they made something very average look like a whole lot of fabulous. The lobby area and entry are very beautiful and the staff was very nice at check in. Actually I’ll go ahead the staff was actually the good part. Very friendly and welcoming. The Coyote was walking around from kids camp and greeted the family. We had an issue with our safe and security came immediately to correct it and when we needed a fan one was brought promptly, after the second call. The hotel itself is older and in need of some updates. All the rooms are outdoor entry which was definitely different and a little motel 6ish but obviously not something that can be changed. But it could be cleaned. The walkways and parking areas need to be swept or blown, there is a lot of debri from trees and bushes, just a lot of general grounds maintenances needs to be done. The exterior of the hotel really needs to be painted and touched up. And the balcony of our room desperately needed a good clean. I’m pretty sure the chairs hadn’t been cleaned all year. The water park (I use that term loosely) was ok. Two pools that were very good size and a good lazy river but only one water slide. It’s made to sound in marketing like it’s a lot more than it is. There were a couple other pools with the hotel buildings and they were very good size and the area around it was very clean. Our pool was the ice st part of the resort to us. Our room was clean, again just older and in need of a spruce up. The breakfast at Rico’s was good and the staff was nice. I was glad I booked quite a while back and the points weren’t too high. Because if it had been a lot of points or I’d have paid what they think it’s worth on the booking app, I’d have been VERY unhappy. It’s time to step it up Hilton and make this resort what those of us who have been loyal members for over 20 years expect.

We have eaten here before and it is a nice restaurant, we had food from the set lunch menu. My wife had the crispy chicken and I had the Beetroot and feta salad. The starters were good and arrived quickly, the mains however did take a little while. The restaursnt wasn't quiet but most of the people arrived before us. It did seem that it was a bit slow. My wife had to leave before me when I asked to get and pay the bill, trying emphasise the point that we need to rush, the bill arrived but no way of paying. Unfortunately I didn't bring enough cash.

While there are no shortage of restaurants in Chicago, Il Porcellino's ambience, unbelievable food and service set it apart. We arrived early for a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. We loved our experience at the bar so much we decided to eat dinner there as well. This was some of the best dining service I've had in a long time. The thoughtfulness and attention to detail from ever person we encountered truly made our experience perfect. The lasagna is a must, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. For dessert, we tried the salted caramel semifreddo and it blew my mind. Couldn't rave about this place enough. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d10096515-r714325746-Il_Porcellino-Chicago_Illinois.html\n",

The first tie was great. This time managed to be amazing! Our waiter 'Jack' is probably the best waiter I have ever come across! Cracking jokes, making everyone laugh constantly (I swear I developed a 6 pack from this alone!) we were also seated on a table with great people. Had brilliant banter in the dark with them and Jack. We were the only guests left in the place at the end of the night. Never laughed this much in a restaurant before. Food was superb. Chose the 'exotic' menu and was pleasantly surprised how good it all tasted...especially when I found out what I actually ate at the end. Can't recommend this place enough.....and if you're lucky to be served by Jack, your enjoyment will definitely increase exponentially! In addition, to the reviewers complaining about 'tepid' food, surely eating piping hot food in total darkness is a recipe for disaster?...pun intended. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d733255-r311813111-Dans_Le_Noir_London_Dining_in_the_dark-London_England.html\n",

During my long lifetime I have sampled eateries throughout America, Europe, the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia .I always look forward to my thrice annual visits to Kildare among other reasons because I get to visit one of my absolute favorites, The Hanged Man. It is in the country situated as it is, beautifully on the edge of a canal, this historic building looks as if it were an ancient inn. One walks in to a warm and comfortable atmosphere, greeted by the hospitable Pat Kean and invited to sit at a table by the bar while drinks and wine are ordered and Pat explains the daily specials which are set out on a large blackboard. When your table is ready you are escorted into one of the convivial dining rooms and attended by a friendly and skilled staff who neither neglect you or hurry you. I’m not recommending any particular dish because I have never had anything that I didn’t enjoy thoroughly. All I can say of the food, the staff and the ambience is that they are all superb. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g315876-d1133546-r629203311-The_Hanged_Man_s_Pub_Restaurant-Newbridge_County_Kildare.html\n",

Reasonable choice for vegetarians, brilliant choice for meat eaters - check out the Veggie Legend - awesome and so huge I couldn't open my mouth wide enough to bite into it. Service was brilliant and the atmosphere was buzzing. Nobody seemed to mind either when my friend and myself sang along to Robert Palmer's 'Addicted to Love'. After our meal we spent about an hour looking at the memorabilia on the walls of the restaurant. I was thrilled to see the outfit that Freddie Mercury wore to one of his concerts and there is a whole room dedicated to Elvis.

Check in was good, took way too long for our bags to arrive, service around the pool was very difficult. Everyone looking for service and getting impatient. They took all our used towels when cleaning the room even though they were hung up and didn't replace them. Very annoying, we raced back to our room for a quick shower before heading out for a show. What they did leave was a flannel under every item in the room. Keys, glass, makeup. I think we had about half a dozen flannels around. Very tacky, we are not in Bali. All of the above I would not of complained about as overall we did enjoy our stay. On returning home I realised I had left my $300 hair straightener and brush behind. I rang the hotel and spoke to lost and found. I was told that the items hadn't come down yet and she would call me back when they had. I did receive a phone call shortly after only to be told it hadn't turned up. I asked if the room could be checked again and was told it couldn't due to new people in the room. That night I then wrote a private message to them on their facebook site stating that I felt they could check at turn down time. And that they should be able to find it again the next day as I am sure the new people wouldn't take it, thinking it was hotel property like the hair dryer. I did receive a reply saying that they would pass my message onto the correct department. I haven't heard anything since. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g4212605-d10748736-r725778323-Crown_Towers_Perth-Burswood_Victoria_Park_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html\n",

The building was updated, clean & conveniently located with plenty of free parking. The Wifi signal was strong throughout. We had a double room (4 adults) and although not huge, definitely roomy enough for just a few days. The fireplace in the room was a lovely (surprise) touch. Full breakfast was included and wonderful - typical eggs, sausage, cereals, but some lovely additions like make your own waffles, lots of fruit and yogurt. Although a buffet breakfast, the staff was very attentive regarding removing dirty dishes, etc. As an early riser, I appreciated the coffee in the lobby (in addition to in the room). The coffee in the room was decent as well - what made it even nicer was real cream & milk in the fridge (not nasty powder whitener). Would stay again - the outdoor pool looked lovely & the menus posted for both in house restaurants seemed decent but we didn't eat at either. Conveniently located not too far from the city centre, but if you have a car it's perfect!

      "129600 Not as good as we're used too. ---SEP--- Stayed here with my husband for a landmark birthday. I had pre-booked a room on the top floor (Qclub) as a special treat and had ordered a bottle of champagne for the room as we checked in. I had actually booked this room and spoke with the service manager that day who assured us that the champagne would be in the room when we entered and would shortly after knock on the door and take us down to the bar for a free drink. But, alas as we entered the room there was nothing there. I was very disappointed as we had friends waiting for us in Leeds and we had postponed meeting them due to what the hotel had promised us. Eventually I told my husband that things had gone wrong and I went down and there was a young man talking to the concierge, I told him about what had happened and I could see that the penny had dropped. He had forgotten about the champagne. I knew it was him that I had spoke to on the phone when I had booked. That said, he did go out of his way and fulfil what I had arranged and organised a drink for us in the bar. What I would say that has changed about the Queens, is that the quality of the breakfast has drastically changed for the worst, In the Q lounge, the milk for cereal was warm and tasted sour, the continental selection was wilted and the meats looked off and inedible. The quality of the bread for toast was insultingly poor, there was no jam or marmite just a saucer of marmalade? and, they have even stopped serving fresh pots of tea and coffee. You were offered the use of a rubbish coffee machine of which you had to wait ages for it to make you half a cup of coffee and then stick your cup under again for a full cup. By the end you had a tepid frothy powdery vile undrinkable mess. In the restaurant, the breakfast choice was reduced, clap cold sausage and bacon, the kitchen staff kept piling freshly cooked food on top of old cooked food and that wasn't even warm. Completely lacked attention to detail regarding how the hot food was maintained.Loud and brash waitresses shouting in your ears. This is quite a mixed review and I feel the Queens should take note of their regulars' comments. The reception staff particularly Laura and the concierge as we checked in and during our stay were outstanding with their friendliness, efficiency and were happy and helpful, however the guy that checked us out was a miserable ignorant incompetent and needs to be taken off reception for further training. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186411-d193579-r197780621-The_Queens_Hotel_Leeds-Leeds_West_Yorkshire_England.html\n",

      "2809566 Our Third Stay at this Hotel in Branson. ---SEP--- First we only live about 3 hours from Branson and frequent the area a couple of times a year mainly for the wonderful shopping at the Landing. The Landing is a large collection of various types of retail outlets for both he and she. One end is anchored by the Belk Dept. Store while the other end by Bass Pro. We have found the Hilton Promenade at the Landing just the ideal for us being an upscale and very well maintained hotel with full services. We find unless we desire to attend a show elsewhere in Branson it is a park the car in the hotel garage and pack it up when ready to return home as the Landing has everything needed for a few days. The hotel is just as new and clean as the whole region with full facilities. Being an upscale hotel it is probably at the upper price range but well worth it for a short stay. The ability to not have to try and play \"bumper car\" for a parking space by having hotel garage parking with unlimited coming and going during your stay is great. The hotel is located about mid-way along the Landing so is convenient to go and return at your leisure. One thing I find outstanding at this hotel is with the dual elevators in our portion of the hotel elevator availability was exceptional and always available immediately when desired. Great beds, pillows and their triple sheeting just feels like true luxury, individual guest controlled central room heating and cooling, large spacious bathrooms with individual and separate showers and tub areas and just everything you would expect in a top level hotel is available if needed. Hope you enjoy this hotel as much as we have in our visits. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d589609-r239677907-Hilton_Promenade_at_Branson_Landing-Branson_Missouri.html\n",

      "2152134 Do Not Eat Here ---SEP--- We stayed here as we were attending a show close by. The staff at reception were lovely, couldn’t ask for nicer. We decided to eat here before the show. The restaurant was not at all busy. Jamie i think his name was took our order and was very friendly and made us feel welcome. He deserves a medal and a pay rise as he seemed to be trying to run the bar and the restaurant. It took ages for our food to come. When it did there was nothing special about it. Two of our party got theirs and another had to wait. A member of staff called Angela who i think is a manager or something then brought out pepper sauce to go with her meal (which she hadn’t got yet) when i asked about her meal i was told very abruptly it was coming. It then took at least another 10 minutes for that. I didn’t find this member of staff very pleasant at all. Someone else made a complaint about the service and she made a face to another member of staff - not very professional at all. On the other hand we witnessed Jamie being very polite and apologising. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186534-d287350-r561259865-Campanile_Hotel-Glasgow_Scotland.html\n",

Again it was lovely and made me actually enjoy eating broccoli for once in my life.

I had intended to walk to find an Indian, or similar, but it was a cold evening and the local area is full of anonymous hotels but no separate restaurants. The next day I found Kelvinside - much livelier and more varied. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186534-d225280-r246725160-Hallmark_Hotel_Glasgow-Glasgow_Scotland.html\n",

Service was lovely and efficient, food was served quickly after we ordered. The food itself was amazing, very fresh, we went for one chicken and one pork gyoza dish, both with rice, both types of gyoza were so good. Portion size was excellent, flavours were well balanced and very, very good. The place is pretty small so be prepared to take the food elsewhere, we did eat in and it was lovely if a little cramped (don’t let that put you off).

      "3209985 Clean, cosy and comfortable ---SEP--- Although many will say that this place is old, noisy and etc etc etc but it's a matter of personal opinions. I find this place cosy and comfortable. Even during the hot days, I don't need to turn on the air conditioner because the apartment that I stayed in manage to contain the coolness of the air. To top it off, both Cameron and Paul are very accomodating and kind. I'm impress by the after hour check-in and they're so handy, great idea! There are always room for improvement: - An introductory material for information and reminder will be handy either attached to the back of the door or given as patrons are checking into the apartments. Information such as daily cleaning services time, office opening hours, where windows are unable to be open for safety reason (Cameron did offer alternative room but decided to stay -personal choice) and how to obtain motel facilities (although there's a map but more implying for other services such as hair dryer). Being a female so I've to be honest here, I did have a bit of panic when arrived where I couldn't find the hair dryer! But I'm all for asking and did ask the next day for it via the office when it opens. - Another nice to have and handy is to add an extra bin in the bathroom. Apart from the above, I'm very happy and thank you very much for such a pleasant and enjoyable stay. Definitely, I'll be back on my next visit! :) https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g3317292-d1592985-r244219964-Burswood_Lodge_Motel_Apartments-Rivervale_Belmont_Greater_Perth_Western_Austral.html\n",
      "1099047 'Fab Friday' ---SEP--- We stumbled across this excellent deal as usually book through a comparison website but the 'Fab Friday' can only be found on the hotel website. Although we stayed as a couple, the deal is aimed at families & is an even better bargain for them. Having stayed in other hotel chains as a family I think the family rooms available at this hotel are more superior, with proper beds (rather than sofa beds) & connecting rooms. The room was exceptionally clean & well maintained with an upgrade available for an additional £10. Car parking is available onsite which is an added bonus for a hotel in a city location & there are plenty of spaces. The hotel has it's own restaurant & bar but as the hotel is within easy walking distance of the city centre we didn't use either We would definitely return https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186411-d507795-r182910076-Clayton_Hotel_Leeds-Leeds_West_Yorkshire_England.html\n",

Parking underneath. Check in/out was easy and the couple of staff we did speak to were friendly and helpful. The only downside was that we arrived late on the Friday evening and checked out Saturday morning so didn't get to spend much time in the hotel but that's because of our plans so nothing to do with the hotel! Mini bar stocked and included in the room, nespresso machine and kettle. Lovely spacious room with the perfect view of the pier (old and new).

I was interested in the new charcuterie board and my gf the ‘Combo’. I asked what was on the board and the waitress (who seemed more interested in cleaning up then waiting on us) stated: “some fruit and nuts which would be good for munching with some other people.” So, I held off on that to see what the apps would be like. Ordered vegetarian spring rolls and the ‘Combo’ and a Stella Artois. The Stella came skunky. Very gross. The spring rolls for 8:50 were 3 greasy little rolls that look like they were sold through some chain store. The ‘Combo’ for $15 was 4 very dry and small chicken wings, a small amount of onion rings and some basic previously frozen fries. Needless to say we did not order anything else, paid and ran https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155023-d183176-r651790808-Rodd_Royalty-Charlottetown_Prince_Edward_Island.html\n",

      "981919 Great Find ---SEP--- I was in town on business and walking back from the grocery store I passed El Hefe. I returned for dinner. It's a very cool looking place. Lots of TVs around the place. It had a great vibe. The larger tables (3 of them I believe) have beer taps with 4 beers available. You pay by the ounce. What a great idea! The table is limited electronically to a certain number of ounces passing through the taps. So if there are 8 people you get x number of ounces allotted. Once you reach that I'm not sure what happens in terms of getting the tap turned back on but you have to admit it's pretty cool. There was Bud Light and 3 micro brews on the table I saw. The food was terrific. I had the Queso Fundido Dip and three tacos. The chicken, carne asada and duck were so gooood. This was one of the best Tex Mex restaurants I've eaten at in some time.

I do like this place and I will keep coming back just coz the food is really nice . https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186299-d11903542-r552189206-Red_Dog_Saloon-Southampton_Hampshire_England.html\n",

      "1375900 This place is not following Hilton standards ---SEP--- Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the stay here. We arrived around 430 pm. Front desk didn't have our reservation in there system. Lucky we brought our conformation and receipt. After being told by the front desk to have a seat in lobby while they fixed the problem. We waited for 30 minutes went up and asked if they got it straighten out they looked at me like what am I talking about. The lady that was helping us decided to go home for the day and not tell anyone we were seating in the lobby waiting. After 2 hours waiting they finally got us a room. We entered into a room that was not cleaned. Trash can full. Pills on the floor and a dirty tub we had to clean. I travel all over the country mostly staying at Hilton property's this place is a joke. I guess because they have a great location water front they slack on other things. Management should take a step back and really look at what's going on here. The restaurant and bar are some of the best I've been too. But front desk and house keeping should be retrained or replaced. I'll dine here again but never stay here. It's not like this place is cheap. Much better service is expected when charging 400 a night. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d619451-r448521357-Hilton_Fort_Lauderdale_Beach_Resort-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html\n",
      "1515004 Very friendly and helpful hosts but the rooms need some upgrading ---SEP--- Michael and Ross, our hosts, are lovely people – very friendly and helpful. They took us on a tour up to Fletcher Bay so that we could enjoy the Coromandel Coastal Walk and picked us up at the other end. We had a fabulous day with an interesting commentary from Michael. Full marks. However, we felt that the rooms were looking a little tired and old-fashioned (furniture, fittings etc). An investment in refurbishing and upgrading could transform these spacious units into very desirable accommodation. We also felt that the Continental breakfast was rather underwhelming. We appreciate that many B&Bs do not offer a cooked breakfast (sadly) but a Continental breakfast should offer a variety of fresh fruits, breads, cheeses etc as well as marmalade, jam and Vegemite. Given these comments, I wonder if the accommodation is a little overpriced, but I am not familiar with Coromandel prices. These are intended as constructive comments because, overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hospitality of our great hosts. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g652406-d1210165-r468439038-Breakaway_Bed_Breakfast-Coromandel_Coromandel_Peninsula_Waikato_Region_North_Isl.html\n",

      "234782 All is lovely near the beach.. ---SEP--- Stayed for two nights in one of the single rooms. All arrangements made were smooth and Jeremy was helpful and responsive to questions. Yes, you know the single rooms are small, don’t make it the focus! If you are tall and need space, you will need to explore other rooms. Yes, there are a lot of stairs, but once you’ve taken up your luggage, it’s manageable. There is some noise at night, mainly the gulls & people finishing their evening. You may need to close your window, but may also depend on location of your room. The SR is well appointed, including a FRIDGE!!!!!, hairdryer, an upright fan, a cereal box & bowl, snacks and bottled water as well as usual hot drinks and UHT semi-skimmed milk. Some of the snacks are replenished I believe. There are miniature toiletries in bathroom. Located about 25 minutes walk away from rail station, you can have scenic walk along the front or cut through the shopping areas. Lots of shops & restaurants etc in the immediate area. There’s a Sainsbury’s Local, Morrison’s & the Co-op all within walking distance. It was a luxury to go to a concert (yea, El Divo) at the Brighton Centre and then walk back to your affordable hotel! We also took a bus to Eastbourne to enjoy the countryside, but there’s lots to do in Brighton itself. Be realistic about what you have paid for and you will have a great base and enjoy your stay! https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186273-d600197-r687726588-Brighton_Surf_Guest_House-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html\n",

As we waited were we given bread and garlic butter. Menu options were limited for dieter or those with special nutrition needs.

Food was delicious, staff were efficient and friendly with those that sang being excellent performers. It is clear they have a passion for opera and was lovely to be greeted and served by so many smiling faces. As it was our first experience of opera we asked one of the waitresses a number of opera related questions which she happily answered for us. I have to make a special mention for the lady who played the piano so beautifully. I liked the way the manager both welcomed us and was also there to say goodbye at the end of the evening. It was also nice to be in the company of other customers who were respectfully quiet during each of the performances before showing their obvious appreciation.

      "2907363 Nice Experience - Family Had a Blast! ---SEP--- It’s been a little over a week since we left Oahu and we miss it badly! My family and I (2 adults and 2 kids – 8 and 5 years old) spent 6 Days/5 Nights at this hotel and are overall very happy with the experience. Arrival/Check-In Upon arrival, one of the Valets immediately approached me (even though I came off of a shuttle) and welcomed me. Since it was about 11:30 he stated that it was still a little early for check-in so he offered to hold my luggage after checking in with registration in case rooms weren’t available. I initially reserved with a Partial-Ocean view but inquired about an Ocean-Front upgrade upon check-in. The check-in associate was friendly and gave me some options of what was available. I ultimately chose a beach-facing corner room (since she said they were a tad bigger) and I’m glad I did. We used the extra space for our dive/snorkeling equipment as the room size would have been rather tight without it. Our Accommodations Our Ocean-Front view was EXCELLENT. We got a 180 degree view of the water. Waikiki beach on a sunny day really is beautiful and our view afforded us such pleasures as watching everything happening around us from the pedestrians down below to the surfers across the way. At night we would sleep with our sliding door slightly open with the ocean waves whispering in the background. Hmmm…so what else? Well, it was nice to have a mini-fridge. It was convenient to put fruit from breakfast there to have for snacking on later in the day. The flat-screen TV was nice and the mattresses and pillows were extremely comfy! We used the safe however, thought it would have been a nicer to have the expense included with the room instead of having to pay extra to lock it. Hotel Amenities I really enjoyed their Breakfast on the Beach. You essentially got a glorified continental breakfast but it was pretty good and best of all it was included with your stay saving us time and money. The live music and hula dancer was also a nice touch and really set a nice atmosphere. We would have breakfast and then fill our lunch bags to take snacks along with us for the day. With 2 “hungry all the time” kids it was a nice convenience. Other amenities we used included the internet stations and the on-site activity counters. There was always an internet station available and at $5 for 25 minutes it was more than adequate for me to check emails and bank transactions. The activity desks made it much easier to book a same-day luau, rental car or last minute excursion adding to the conveniences. Our hotel had the amenity “Kids stay, play and eat free.” We took advantage of this and were able to get them on the Atlantis Submarines for free – another cost savings for us. The one thing missing though was a Concierge Desk. This would have been nice as there were times where information about local eateries and businesses, shopping, activities, etc could have been helpful. Other Details I did experience a few details that could have been better. The elevators were hit and miss. Sometimes it would go up when you summoned it to go down. Other times it would go up to the 5th floor and then back down the lobby first when you summoned it to go to the 10th floor. In the elevator lobby on our floor (10th floor) only one of the “down” buttons worked. The one annoyance that really got me the most was the way my key card behaved to my room. It would take at least 6-10 attempts before the key would open the door – and it did this each time we returned. I had the front desk replace my card at least 5 times to which they responded that the key cards are sensitive and easily de-magnetized. It was a huge inconvenience for our stay. Staff Service The one thing that I noticed most here is that the hotel staff seemed genuinely friendly. From the valets to the front desk clerks and even housekeeping, everyone seemed to enjoy being there. The staff was very nice and professional and everyone was helpful whenever asked. Valets were good with driving directions and providing maps and the front desk clerks were pleasant and friendly every time I spoke with them (with my key card issues mentioned above and with contacting Hanauma Bay for hours of operation). Final Thoughts I would definitely stay here again. Addressing the details mentioned above would have made my stay a bit more enjoyable. I would have given the hotel a 5 star rating however I’m rating it a 4 star because of my consistently spotty key card. Other than that though, the hotel is nice and, all things considered, is a great value. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d86978-r15434087-Aston_Waikiki_Beach_Hotel-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html\n",

      "1702469 Very nice hotel with a central location! ---SEP--- Stayed here for a week half business/half pleasure. I have been to Honolulu many times and I find this location is great. It is right on the edge of Waikiki park and the beginning of the hotel beaches. The hotel is a nice mixture of old and new. There are balconies and you face either the Diamond Head or the west and get sunsets and a view of the Outrigger Hotel. If you are a Starwood member you get 35% off food purchases at some of their restaurants and free wifi. We had a car and used the free parking in their lot around the corner. At first we thought it was inconvenient, but after the first day we realized you could walk through the Sheraton lobby and is wasn't bad at all. A couple of things worth noting - clean service was nice cause they got to the rooms quickly -- sometimes we find hotels are very slow in cleaning the rooms. They also give 2 free water bottles a day. The hotel is a busy place, we must have seen at least 2 or 3 weddings there a day. And people are coming and going all the time. There is a nice coffee shop right next door. People we were with used the workout facility and said it was perfectly fine. Personally I like being able to walk the beach and around the streets easily. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d87102-r351380818-Moana_Surfrider_A_Westin_Resort_Spa_Waikiki_Beach-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html\n",

A washing machine and dryer was also provided. The kitchen was reasonably well equipped and the Nespresso machine is a nice touch.

Breakfast in the morning was good. there were a couple of occasions when we needed to ask for food items to be 'topped up'. A lot of work is taking place at the resort. The rates were very good considering. looking forward to getting back when it is all completed!! https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g1059779-d644513-r488360080-RACV_Cape_Schanck_Resort-Cape_Schanck_Mornington_Peninsula_Victoria.html\n",
      "1395587 Hampton Inn - Polaris ---SEP--- The Hampton Inn at Polaris in the Columbus, OH, area is a well maintained Hilton property. The hotel is clean and well maintained and run by helpful staff. When I travel to this area, I usually look to stay at this property as it is conveniently located near an I-71 and the Polaris shipping area. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50226-d878115-r551007086-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Columbus_Polaris-Columbus_Ohio.html\n",

The rooms were clean and spacious, and one room had a plate of goodies and some bottled waters awaiting us. Our views were of the garden and the bay...very beautiful! My family commented that the other patrons mostly all seemed to be quite a bit older, and they enjoyed sitting in the sun room and other common areas, which looked lovely. I would stay there again but not have the breakfast, as it was not as good as we had hoped it to be. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186609-d214568-r391426061-Galway_Bay_Hotel-Galway_County_Galway_Western_Ireland.html\n",

When I first walked in I was greeted by a pleasant young lady at the front desk who handled my check in quickly and worry free. The rooms were VERY spacious and clean, and I got the 2 bedroom. We stayed for a week and imagine our surprise when they have a small food bar in the evening and hotel social where they serve complimentary wine and beer. As a family, we loved the Sonesta and would recommend this establishment to anyone.

It feels quite peaceful but at the same time there are plenty of activities to keep the family occupied including tennis, giant chess board, pool and spa. Our initial room that we were allocated had a problem with the air conditioning. The heating was not working so maintenace was contacted to fix it. Unfortunately it was unable to be repaired quickly so we were moved to a different unit. The unit was lovely, clean and comfortable. The staff at the resort were very friendly and the manager was exceptional to deal with. Unfortunately the pool is not heated so the kids were unable to use it. It would be a great asset in summer though. I would highly recommend to stay at this resort. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255111-d581997-r685556724-Ramada_Resort_by_Wyndham_Rotorua_Marama-Rotorua_Rotorua_District_Bay_of_Plenty_Re.html\n",

Saw another guest booking in and they were told they could book breakfast at the cheaper price when it was convenient to them. The room was tired and unclean - lots of dust on top of wardrobe, dirty curtains, chair grubby, stains on the duvet. Windows do not open therefore had to turn on the air conditioning. I stayed at the hotel as I was attending a wedding and on the morning of the wedding there was no hot water - had to use a kettle to wash my hair!

Right across the road from Waikiki beach fabulous views both day and night. Highly recommend the spa, had a wonderful hour and a half there, well worth the money. A little disappointed with our rooms, thought they were a little ordinary and tired. The toilet backed up and flooded on our last day and as the toilet is in the bathroom itself we had to shower in our daughters room but they did comp us the resort fee.

      "2011762 Country manor charm + big chain amenities ---SEP--- Normally I do an obsessive amount of research before choosing a hotel, but when I learned that other Earthquakes soccer fans were staying at the Country Inn for the playoff game, I booked a room. I could not have been happier. I've stayed in my share of chain hotels -- who hasn't? -- and my expectations were not exceptionally high. So I was surprised to walk into a reception area that felt more like a cozy living room than an impersonal hotel lobby. The clerk at the desk -- in fact, everyone I encountered at the CI&S -- hit the right note of service, pleasant and friendly without being obsequious or unctuous. Our room, a non-smoking double queen, was generously sized and included a refrigerator and microwave. The bathroom was equally spacious. I was a little concerned about noise as our window looked out on the entrance, but it was quiet and the beds comfortable. Breakfast is included, and the choices were impressive compared to the options in most U.S. hotels. There were quite a few kids lined up to use the make-your-own-waffle iron, and it's a testament to the high quality of service that the serving and dining areas remained immaculate. The staff cares about making your stay a positive experience, and I think that's what makes the difference. They could not have been nicer. My only knock against the CI&S is that it's kind of in the middle of nowhere. It's reasonably close to the airport and to the soccer stadium, but a 20 minute drive into downtown Denver. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance, but the location itself feels kind of sterile. For our purposes, that didn't matter, but if we'd gone to Denver to explore the downtown area, it wouldn't have worked for us. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d530585-r87331424-Country_Inn_Suites_By_Radisson_Denver_International_Airport-Denver_Colorado.html\n",

As a past regular user of the Gibson both for business and pleasure (I have to admit it’s been 6 months since my last visit ) I have decided this is my last visit. For a start the room rates have gone up way past an inflationary increase in my opinion and nothing fresh in the rooms apart from the free water bottle decreasing in size and silly little signs put under the beds telling us that we are so lucky that staff have even cleaned under the bed for us......... yeh right . One of my favourite meals at the Coda Eatery has always been the Thai Green Chicken curry and even that has now been transform into a one bowl blob of rice surrounded by a lacklustre and barely warm pool of badly spiced coconut milk offering. I’m guessing that some cost cutting is at play here or was in because it was so busy with a concert taking place next door at the Point that they were making the curry in a big bucket in the chicken and spooning it out to cope with the volume .... so disappointing. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d1765611-r748809915-The_Gibson_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html\n",

Big bathroom, spotlessly clean. Our only criticism is that this is an old building with old single glazed windows and is on a very busy main road and we even had what sounded like the bin men at 4:30am, so unfortunately not a great nights sleep. However - our evening in the bar was most enjoyable with a good meal and live jazz.

The first room they gave us was very dirty, with mould growing everywhere, the small room heater was disgustingly filthy, the staff and dogs used the room as a thoroughfare, and when we complained, their attitude was \"go somewhere else\".

After a short wait, we were seated and we saw that the restaurant is relatively small so if you're looking to eat here, probably best to make reservations. The food is phenomenal. My wife had a boxty dish and I had the traditional Irish (lamb) stew. Both were very good, but I would have to give the edge to my wife's steak and boxty dish. The service was great! Our waiter was able to give us some advice on ordering and our food was ready very quickly. The location in Temple Bar could be good or bad, depending on what you're looking for. We finished around 9:30 and it seemed that that area was just starting to get crazy with drinking partying.

So we decided to have a drink in the lobby/lounge. It has a wonderful view of the harbour and was very relaxing. The bar staff were very attentive and friendly with taking our order. Our room was ready slightly early which was great - our room overlooked the harbour and had a Juliette balcony which was great. Included in our package was champagne and chocolates which were in the room already. The decor is so interesting and unique. Definitely the comfiest bed that I have slept on. The bathroom had a shower and a free standing bath. Dinner was exceptional the atmosphere was great as well as the food. We then opted to have dinner to the room which was lovely as there was enough room to sit at the table in our room over looking the harbour. It was nice that there was no tray charge for having breakfast in the room which so many hotels have!

      "2781826 Doing Vegas Palazzo Lux style is the only way to go ---SEP--- We have stayed at the Palazzo now 3 times this year and will be coming back for a 4th before the year is over. Each visit (all 4 or 5 nights) in Feb, July and Sept 2014, we have always felt cared for in every way.After our first stay here there has never been any debate about staying anywhere else in town, because we really believe that you'd be hard pressed to beat it. It's not the cheapest for sure, but for what you get, it's pennies on the dollar for the memories that you will have gained staying here. The rooms, the casino, the spa, dinning options, and the service is all top notch. The Grazie loyalty program has also worked out well and has helped us come back every few months to what is becoming our home away from home. My favorite feeling is walking in to the beautiful lobby and breathing it all in knowing for the next few days we are going to have an amazing time. The location, away a little from the busier center strip is perfect for us. We can get to anywhere we need to fast just by walking a bit, and also love that we can get in and out of the hotel fast too. Staying at other hotels it was always an epic journey to just get through the masses and back up to the room. That will not happen here to the extent that it happens at other resorts on strip. The casino is easy to navigate and manage. The shops in the Grand Canal and across the street at the Fashion Show Mall is perfect for getting what you need quickly. Laying out at the pool is awesome as you can go to shady spots or sunny spots whichever you prefer. I also like that it's a little more laid back feel throughout the whole resort. My wife always has a fantastic spa day during our trip while I get a chance to get away and gamble in the casino. I think the standard luxury king room is about the same size as some apartments I've lived in. During one of our stays in September this year we were celebrating both my wife's and my birthdays in the same month (we are about a week and half apart) and someone at hotel was kind enough to notice and send up a red velvet birthday cake after check in that we ate pieces of the whole trip to celebrate. Again something that will always be remembered. That feeling of being treated extra special is pennies on the dollar. Some folks have a house on a lake or beach house they like to escape to from time to time to get away. Well, we have the Palazzo, as our lake house now (with a view of lake down the strip looking out 30+ floors high) and hope they keep continuing exceeding expectations every time. Grazie to you Palazzo! This place is worth a chance for you to experience. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d675000-r234627959-The_Palazzo_at_The_Venetian-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html\n",

      "567625 Pros & Cons ---SEP--- We stayed here for3 nights. Staff were very good, the saving grace of this hotel . Hotel was recently renovated I was told !! A couple of corridors could have done with a lick of paint and please turn off the awful air freshener blowing into one of the corridors I had to pass through regularly . In fairness to the staff they did give me a little upgrade to a larger room as I wasn't pleased when I saw the room I was being given but it seems all the rooms are painted in a hideous yellow colour. The paint colours and decor in the rooms left a lot to be desired. The paint colours elsewhere in the hotel were nice and soft and the dining room looked very nice. I would also say please invest in bigger & better towels. The bath towels were tiny and definitely not fluffy. Not major things but I definitely wouldn't call anything in the hotel luxurious , except maybe the Spa. The \"hot\" breakfasts were cold , well as we found out, a couple of things each morning were warm but the rest were cold . I did mention it to a member of staff the first morning and she was very appreciative of me telling her but nothing changed, not her fault obviously . Most things I could eat a little bit cold but the fried eggs were really congealed and stone cold, the beans were also very cold , strangely one morning out of three the sausages were really hot. Everything else for breakfast was superb , great choices of breads, cereals, pastries , wonderful granola etc. and great serving staff. We dined there one evening as well , again , the waiting staff were excellent, starters & mains very good . The best chowder I ever tasted. Main course , beef excellent , veg good , red wine jus was not red wine jus it was just gravy , so glad I asked for it on the side. Ice cream was the worst ever , obviously the cheapest ice cream ever just bought in. It was tasteless and watery , couldn't eat any of it. The highlight of my visit was the spa the treatments were lovely as were all the girls. Joanne the reception was very welcoming and obliging and the massage from Natalie was the highlight of my whole stay. Best back & neck massage I've ever had and such a lovely girl . The hotel reception staff too were very nice , a girl called Amy was very pleasant and the manager/ asst. manager called Hamel (I think ) was very obliging and friendly .

His sourcing of fresh, unique ingredients within my home district (Katandra/Goulburn Valley), encouraged our 2hr venture to experience Baah Lah. Totally Blowin-away would be an understatement. The flavours of each dish, blended so well. Your expectations & excitement for your next plate did not disappoint. From the Pork Belly Boas, the salmon, the duck, the oysters❤️❤️❤️.

The staff was attentive, the room clean and the breakfast wonderful with a great variety of food. We were able to park our car there and and leave it for the duration of our cruise. They provided a shuttle service to the ship dock and a return service when we got back in port. This is a great choice if you are visiting Tampa whether going on a cruise or just visiting the area. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34678-d235709-r165175702-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tampa_East_Brandon-Tampa_Florida.html\n",

We took advantage of our complimentary beverages for having hotel loyalty and stayed for a few more. The beer selection on tap is plentiful and appealing to all beer drinkers.

We found the hotel to be very good .Check in was quick and the staff were very friendly.

The front desk and bell staff are particularly helpful and able to answer pretty much any question you have. The lobby area is spacious and comfortable and there is a business room with a couple of PC's and free internet access and printing. The rooms are spacious and were once the accommodation for the resident bunnies when this was a Bunny Club in the mid 70's. The bar area is pleasant with a fair selection of local beers and the bar meals are well above average. The restaurant is spacious, light and airy and you don't feel hemmed in. The food is good and the buffet breakfast very good. Prices are what would be expected in this type of hotel, a little overpriced for what you get but not so bad to leave you feeling fleeced - the tax and gratuity take care of that feeling! https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d83097-r181373640-Warwick_Denver_Hotel-Denver_Colorado.html\n",

Its very well managed and the food is constistently delicious! BUT (and thats a BIG but) the Hotel staff stroke me as a bunch of deers in headlights. I stayed for a total of 10 days when my place was flooded, and believe it or not a whole month after my stay I still had to deal with them in order to get refunded... Overall, I was refunded twice and the total of the refunds was 200$! Let's just say there was nothing pleasant and relaxing about this place or my stay (except breakfast at the restaurant, again, *amazed*) I was given a certain price on the phone, but once I arrived at the hotel the price had suddenly increased considerately. (About 100$, oh and that's without the \"security deposit\" fee... Which you'd think they would have told you on the phone but no.) The manager was very rude and not willing to help nor cooperate at all which was causing a lot of stress on top of my stress. Thankfully all of this is behind me but I sure as hell would not have wanted to pay for this kind of service. What a shame . https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g182166-d188275-r263073471-Ramada_Plaza_Gatineau_Manoir_du_Casino-Gatineau_Outaouais_Region_Quebec.html\n",

There is a variety of accommodation available from dorms to cabins, campervan spaces and tent sites. We loved camping there, because on the 7 acre site we were away from the loudness of the nightclubs on the main street. There are several kitchens, a swimming pool, a bar and a laundry area. Wi-fi is $4 for 24 hours or more for longer, and you have to sit in the reception areas to use it. There are a bunch of bean bags there to sit on. As a guest you get a variety of discount deals and two-for-one specials from businesses in town, which is great for those trying to travel on the cheap. And yes, there are plenty of plugs to recharge all those annoying electronics! https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g261596-d2196300-r299389971-Base_Backpackers_Airlie_Beach-Airlie_Beach_Queensland.html\n",

We got a very substantial breakfast - I had the vegetarian breakfast which was excellent and my wife was very pleased with her full-Irish (all the components of which were tasty). We got great large cups of decaf coffee. Our breakfast set us up for the day. The service was both friendly and efficient. The place was a bit drafty but that was probably more to do with the prevailing weather conditions. It is a popular breakfast spot and some people had to wait for tables to become available. While it offers a limited menu I would have to say what they do they do very well. We didn't get to sample an evening meal but I have no reason to believe that it wouldn't be first class. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d3524810-r546428339-Copper_Alley_Bistro-Dublin_County_Dublin.html\n",

The atmosphere was very bland, the staff took along time to even take our drinks order and so much so we were ordering drinks at the same time as food. We ordered two bloody mary cocktails. These arrived in pint classes with no garnish and highly spiced. Usually in a high end establishment you are asked how spicy you would like it and it is served in an attractive manner. It was hard to get staff attention even when they were standing chatting by our table. The food served was very tasty but not very hot which was surprising as the restaurant was not very busy. Overall, we received service you would expect from a low end restaurant chain and the atmosphere was disappointing considering the average price of £60 a head. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1213167-r334376194-Cinnamon_Kitchen_City-London_England.html\n",

The breakfast was good and had scrambled eggs or omelets. The fitness room had all that he needed, but the tv only had a few channels. The internet worked fine. The room allowed enough space for his computers and other paperwork. The airport shuttle was helpful since he didn't rent a car for this trip. Only one problem was that the air conditioner was loud, so he woke up in the night once in a while. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d224305-r138358393-Hampton_Inn_Fort_Lauderdale_Airport_North_Cruise_Port-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_Coun.html\n",

We selected the Hilton due to its proximity to the beach as well as Ft. Lauderdale’s airport. Needless to say, we were thrilled with the selection. Our experience with the hotel staff was exceptional. Kym Nielsen went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable. We cannot thank him enough for his professionalism and extra efforts during our visit. My wife and I can be very lazy on vacation, so our time at the hotel consisted of laying by pool (even though you can throw a rock and hit sand), lots of room service (the amount of breakfast is beyond belief), as well as frequent visits to the hotel bar (thanks Ryan and Matthew for those martini’s)! We had dinner at Grille 401 – apparently it is fairly new on Las Olas. Highly recommend. We also had dinner at S3 which is attached to the hotel. Again, highly recommend.

The first thing I noticed was that the beer I ordered was ice cold. I know that does not sound like a big deal, however, too often, the beer is an acceptable temperature, but not noticeably icy. This really started things off well. My wife ordered a burger and fries that was very fresh and cooked perfectly. I ordered the smoked chicken that came with beans and cole slaw. The chicken was served sliced and they provided 3 different barbecue sauces , Texas, Memphis, and Carolina styles, to eat on the chicken. I really liked that the chicken was not served with anything on it. I could try all three sauces. My favorite was the Texas style. The portions were generous and the food tasted great.

The room was adequately stocked with Keurig coffee and bathroom products. The refrigerator had 2 complimentary bottles of water waiting for us. We did not use the pool but it looked very clean. Our daughter's flight was to arrive at 11:20pm, but it ended up being delayed 3 times before finally being cancelled. We spoke to the clerk at the front desk and they allowed us to extend our check-out to 1:00pm the following day. The late check-out worked perfectly because our daughter arrived at 1:15pm. We have stayed at this hotel before and would do so again. My only complaint is that I did not know that I could adjust the firmness of the mattress so I slept on a very hard mattress on one side and very soft mattress on the other. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d1235801-r217539431-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Indianapolis_Airport-Indianapolis_Indiana.html\n",

It included a garden room (with a glimpse of ocean), balcony (cockatoos included, don't feed them!), kitchenette, separate bathroom, separate bedroom with queen bed and a lounge area. It also came with breakfast, what a bargain! The accommodation is well placed so it allows you to walk into town, to supermarkets and stroll around and indulge in all the cafes and restaurants Lorne has on offer. We went on a sort of mid week (out of school holidays) trip; that was Sunday evening to Wednesday. So be aware that some eateries don't open on Monday or Tuesday. We had one dinner at the Mantra restaurant and the food was fantastic. There is happy hour at some of the venues (including the hotel) and we especially loved the Lorne beach pavilion where you can sip on a happy hour cocktail special while watching the waves roll in. You also have Movida, two pubs (one near the pier), funky eateries like IPSOS and healthy seaside options like HAH. We especially loved a walk and a morning coffee at the swing bridge cafe. All a short walk from your hotel. The Mantra also has a good sized pool, gym and steam room which we utilised.

      "2602165 Unaccommodating and unfriendly owner's wife ---SEP--- We have been here quite a lot of times because the food, to be fair, is excellent. One on occasion, i asked for a slice of onion on my tuna sandwich. The reply was 'it doesn't come with onion'. I said that I knew that but I would like just a couple of rings if possible. She then made me buy a whole side salad so i could put one onion ring on it which i thought was pretty petty seeing as though they must have plenty in the kitchen. On another occasion I chose pie which was listed with potatoes. I asked if I may have chips instead. My friends also asked for chips so she charged another 50p each for this even though they were making chips all the time and the meal already included potatoes. Another time, my mother asked for a small portion and a normal one came. When she told her this, the owner snapped that she should of told her when she ordered (which she did). I also heard a friend's son had asked for one extra sugar for his coffee and she refused as he had already had the 'allotted' amount. When he complained, she told him he was a trouble maker in front of the whole restaurant. Finally, I witnessed 2 young Asian-looking students come in who hadn't booked. She said all the spare tables were reserved...5 minutes later some more 'respectable looking' older white customers came in who said they hadn't booked and she sat them down at one of the vacant tables. Too many unpleasant events to warrant going back which is a shame because her husband, the cook is extremely nice and the food is excellent. I wonder if he is aware how his wife puts people off? https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186262-d6637552-r353265384-Village_Bistro-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html\n",

      "1008074 Imperfections ruin the 5 star experience ---SEP--- Having visited twice now I can safely say that things are not quite right at the Brighton Harbour Hotel. Whilst for the most part, we enjoyed our stay, there have been several issues that did not meet our expectations for the price paid. On our first visit We paid £225 for the cheapest room and upon arrival found we were in a tiny cramped family room with bunk bed. I have stayed in B&Bs for less than £100 and had much nicer and larger rooms than this. When I expressed my views we were offered a complimentary room upgrade on our next visit which we gladly accepted. The room on our second visit was much larger and more what we expected for these prices. However, there were cleaning issues, the tiling in the bathroom was dirty and stained. My partner has an allergy to feathers so asked for a differen pillow only to be told that there weren’t any others available so had to put up with trying to use a make shift pillow resulting in a very disturbed nights sleep. I find the lack of non feather pillows highly unusual and again, no apology was offered for this oversight. I was not very impressed at the unusually late 3pm check in time; most hotels I have stayed in are around 1-2pm check in and we can almost always get into the rooms earlier than this. At the Brighton Harbour we arrived at around 2pm hoping to get into our rooms but we’re told they were not ready so we had to wait in the bar with no form of apology. This was far from ideal as I had a treatment booked in the Spa at 2:30 so ended up having to go to the spa first before checking in. Perhaps not a major issue but all these small details are the things that turn a good hotel into a great one. The Spa itself was lovely although the experience was ruined by a suspicious looking brown stain on my supposedly clean towel! There was also an unpleasant smell in the hot tub area which again, detracted from the luxury experience. Breakfast was VERY expensive, I’m not sure what their policy is but on our first visit we only had to pay around £10 for a full buffet. I was therefore slightly aggrieved to turn up for breakfast on our second visit to find that it was A La Cate for cooked breakfast at £16.95! The Eggs Royale I had was OK but hollandaise far too lemony and overall not worth the price paid. Bar is always very good, lovely staff and great cocktails. Overall, this hotel needs to start addressing the finer details if it wants to charge top end prices and until they are fixed I probably wouldn’t return. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186273-d192535-r642782106-Brighton_Harbour_Hotel_Spa-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html\n",

Our rooms were dated but clean, and there's limited privacy around the hotel - but that's consistent with the intimacy of the whole island. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g295119-d658775-r554928549-Paradise_Hotel_Resort-Norfolk_Island.html\n",

The staff are really helpful and welcoming, a credit to management. The hotel is a bit dingy and shows it's age.

Straight away we where getting tips on a map of the best places to eat & where the local supermarket was. We where driven to our apartment (it's a big place) & we where walked around the apartment showing us where everything was. You could see that they put a lot of effort into making the place really nice. Lots of space, the MOST fantastic views looking over the lake! A little fire which makes the place nice & cosy in an evening & even a separate office area with touch screen computer & printer to use if you need one. DVD's you can borrow from reception too. There's a bus stop right outside the apartment which is very useful. Free parking of you hire a car, which is always a bonus! 10/10, can't fault it!

It has a small entrance and when you go in are greeted by friendly reception staff who tell you all you need to know. The decor is lovely and modern and that’s the type I like :). You go back out of the entrance to the arcade and find the lifts at the back that can only be accessed by keycard. There are four floors of rooms and the Marco Piere restaurant is on the 6th floor (more on that later on). Each room is themed and we had a travel room. On entry to the room it was very spacious and lots of perfect things to make your stay perfect. All wooden floors with a big rug under the bed. Lots of plugs and lights. Iron and hairdryer and ironing board. Desk, rocking chair. A mini fridge safe and tea and coffee. The bathroom was amazing, speaker from the telly comes into the bathroom. Shower is huge! With normal and rain shower with easy buttons to use. Lovely dressing gowns that actually fit as I’m not the skinniest lass around. The bed is big and comfy but I must say woke up with a bad back as it’s quite firm and I don’t like and not used to a firm bed. My husband also had a bad back. Lovely Amazing hotel apart from the bed issue but you might like a firm bed. And also you could here a party or heavy base coming from somewhere but couldn’t say where it was.

It couldn't have been any more perfect. We had a Lakefront Ambassador Suite, so woke up each morning to a beautiful lake view; the small balcony let us enjoy the fresh air whenever we were so inclined. The bed and the pillows were soooo comfortable, and it was quite nice to have a separate sitting area with a microwave, refrigerator, and sink. We went swimming early each morning (my P.T. exercises!), I had a facial one day, a massage the second day, and a manicure the third. The well-appointed Spa was tastefully decorated and very relaxing & the employees were well-trained in their craft. We would either have breakfast or lunch in their restaurant overlooking the lake. The friendly wait staff helped to make it a very pleasurable experience. We used the small \"gym\" as a continuation of my P.T. The hotel had many different spots for sitting, relaxing, reading, and/or visiting. The friendly employees throughout the hotel helped make our trip a very pleasurable occasion.

Their level of service, comfort, cleanliness, and friendliness is always top-notch. The staff is accommodating to requests and are always courteous and helpful. The location of the Westin makes it ideal for any events in the downtown area, particularly the Convention center with their convenient skybridge walkway. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance, from higher-end steakhouses to quick fast food joints, as well as a choice of taverns. The downtown mall is only a block away, so shopping is plentiful also. We highly recommend the Westin for these reasons. It will always be our 1st choice when staying in downtown Indy. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d88186-r236216068-The_Westin_Indianapolis-Indianapolis_Indiana.html\n",

The waitress was friendly and identified specials. The problem arose at the end of our meal. On asking for further information about the Eton Mess, my daughter specifically asked, \"is it strawberries cream and meringue?\" as had it contained anything else, she would not have ordered it. The waitress replied yes. When checking further, my daughter asked again. \"Definitely strawberries?\" And again the waitress stated yes. When it arrived it was strawberries, cream and meringue covered in a sour cherry coulis sauce. My daughter hates cherries and could not eat the desert. My apple and sultana crumble did not have a traditional crumble topping. I'm not sure what it was but was not particularly nice. When going to pay, my daughter talked to the bar man, asking that when telling patrons about the desserts, staff clearly described what a desert contained and explained that she had been unable to eat her dessert and had specifically asked if it was just strawberries, cream and meringue. The Barman was abrupt and rude, stating it had strawberries so it was as described. He did not appear to understand it was the addition of a sour cherry sauce which was not listed on the menus or mentioned by the waitress which was the basis of our concerns. There was no apology . We were not seeking a refund but it was abundantly clear that he felt we should not be making suggestions about how the staff could help patrons decide on food based on accurate descriptions. Disappointed as we have visited many times before and have recommended the restaurant to friends. We will not be returning and will no longer recommend this restaurant. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186299-d800046-r600082334-The_Empress_of_Blandings-Southampton_Hampshire_England.html\n",

The staff make you wait that long even when there are free tables saying 'oh well your time hasn't rum out yet'. The drunks are overpriced. I mention to the staff that I have seen tables downstairs and the rudest lady I have ever met shouts at me in front of what I can only imagine to be her manager. Her manager apologises and makes an excuse that they are all tired from the Xmas period. After shouting at me and seeing a look from her manager she contacts the staff downstairs and a table magically appears to be free from all the other empty tables downstairs. We saw some of the tables free for about half an hour - an hour before they actually seated anybody. Then the toilets were filthy and the waiter was rude and the food was bland.

The restaurant is located within the The D Hotel, located in Freemont Street so if you are staying in one of the strip hotels, consider spending at least $ 20 by taxi. When we finally found the restaurant located next to the casino bathrooms, our table was not available. As my son is 18 years old we could not wait in the restaurant bar, so we had to stay 20 minutes standing at the front desk. Finally our table was ready and we could be reasonably well attended because it was after 22:00 hours and the waiters were in a hurry ... The atmosphere is pleasant, and the steaks are very well prepared.

Public rooms are insufficient - Morse Bar is very small and the Lounge is only available if you are having Afternoon Tea and no seats in reception. Free wifi in rooms but had to continually re-enter password. Annoying. Spa was nice but resent having to spend an additional £15 to use when already paying £225 for a room for the night!! Bit of a rip for a luke warm hot tub and a couple of saunas and steam roooms. Room service was tasty and prompt. The Randolph is a lovely historic building but as a result the floors are rather creaky so don't expect a peaceful stay either.

      "1381607 Staff not as Customer Service Concerned as They Should Be ---SEP--- Here is the email I sent to GM of Residence Inn Tampa Downtown and never have received a reply and sent it to her twice. she could have at least acknowledged it. Email: Hi Mrs. Cotterill, First I want to say that overall we had a nice stay in Tampa. The room was nice and clean and very comfortable. Charges for room and parking were fine. Although we enjoyed our stay, we had some issues that I wanted to bring to your attention. The main issue was breakfast on Monday morning. I called the front desk around midnight and spoke to a gentleman about a wakeup call for Monday morning. I always ask what time breakfast is being served the next morning so I can set the wake up call. The gentleman told me that breakfast would be from 6 am to 10 am on Monday morning. So we had a wake up call for 9 am to get to breakfast before 10. We arrived in the breakfast area at 9:35 and the breakfast bar was closed and cleaned off of items. When I inquired about this, the lady in the breakfast area said breakfast was closed and offered us a piece of fruit. So I went and spoke with Jermel and the lady at the front desk. Jermel didn't say much, but the lady stated that breakfast ended at 9:30 on Monday mornings. When I told her about calling down and asking about breakfast she was very indifferent toward us. When I asked to speak to the manager, she pointed me in the direction of the food manager. When I told her I meant the GM, she said the GM came in at 1pm. We have stayed at several Marriott hotels around the country and several have been Residence Inns. When we have stayed at these hotels on long holiday weekends, the breakfast hours are always extended on the holiday Monday. Even with this knowledge, I still call down and ask about breakfast hours. We were very disappointed in the way we were treated in this incidence, especially when we saw other quests leaving the breakfast area with plates of food they were given from the kitchen and we were only offered a piece of fruit. We also had to wait 20 to 30 minutes at 4:30 in the afternoon to get checked in. Monday morning I was expecting the final total bill to be placed under our room door as is the usual case with Marriotts and Residence Inns, but that was not the case. I had to stand in line for another 20 minutes to check out and had to deal with the same lady as I did about breakfast. I usually don't send emails to GMs, but we had the above problems and I thought you should be aware. Again overall our visit to Tampa was enjoyable. I wish I could say that about our hotel stay. In addition the above, the hotel has a shuttle that we could have taken to the event we were attending, but it stopped running an hour or so before the event ended. If I had a shuttle and had a lot of guests attending an event (which was the case), I would have my shuttle run until the event was over. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34678-d223863-r284390993-Residence_Inn_Tampa_Downtown-Tampa_Florida.html\n",

So we cut our hike short and came to the resort at 4:00pm to check in. Upon arrival we were told our cabin wasn't ready. We were told that the room would be ready by 5:00 so if we could come back then it wouldn't be appreciated since the lobby was full with multiple families in the same situation.

I thought we booked a Queen suite. It turns out room 239 is just a small hotel room, one queen and a sofa bed. Clean as it was, I didn't feel that it was recently renovated comparing it with some pictures I saw on line. The heating unit was also antiquated, although in good working condition - no thermostat setting. Breakfast was adequate, although if you have milk allergies you can't have the omelette - both of them had cheese. And, it looks like the concept of soy/almond/rice milk as substitute is not really known, not only at this hotel, but even at some coffee shops. 4 stars for location, pleasant front desk and cleanliness. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g182183-d248237-r554237861-Holiday_Inn_Express_Suites_Tremblant-Mont_Tremblant_Quebec.html\n",
      "2162121 HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!! ---SEP--- Since the new owner, this place has gone down hill...FAST. I visited this place with 2 visiting friends., as this had been a great restaurant in the past. It took about 10 minutes for the Waitress to stop by, and say Hi. We asked for the Salad and Bread, as per usual. 20 Minutes later the salad, and the bread FINALLY showed up, with tons of apologies from the waitress. The bread was stone cold, and the limp , wet, discusting salad looked as though it had been prepared a day ago. It didnt take long for the salad to be consumed between 4 people, and we were looking for our waitress to take our order. At this time we noticed that the place was filled with people...NOT EATING.20 minutes later we finally found our waitress and brought her back to our table. We ordered, and waited ANOTHER 30 MINUTES, with NO REFILLS ON THE SALAD, POP, AND BREAD OFFERED. Finally, we received our order..consisting of Fish, that was dead cold, and somewhat like cardboard, Pizza, that was ice cold, and dripping with a TON of grease. The other 2 burgers were red not cooked, and stone cold, with cardboard french fries...and you guessed it, COLD!. We let the waitress know our troubles, and the response from her was \"since the new management, this is the way the food is\". The Manager came to our table, at our insistence, and blankly stared as we each complained about the service and food, and his response was \"are you paying or not??!!\".

Staff are very welcoming and friendly always ask about your day etc, the apartments are a fair size and get daily housekeeping. Rooms that have a double in them are two singles put together which is a little uncomfortable, you get free wifi but doesn't work all that well keeps going off and having to re connect and put the password back in. Pool area really nice with a jacuzzi and free bbq facilities, you can also book trips and excursions from the desk right next to reception.

      "1994168 Over priced, worst food ---SEP--- I visited this restaurant on 15th November 2014. Table was booked for 7 pm . On arrivals they took sometime to find us on booking. Soon after just arriving we're approached by 4 different staff , pressurising to order . We asked for some time but it continued. I thought I would have beer but the so called butler in tie thought I should have wine to star and beer with food, wine arrived and cocktail for my wife Again pressurised to order food , we asked for some time to look at the menu,he promised popadams and chutney will be sent . We ordered Bhajias as starter . Waited for while , meanwhile another waiter came asking us to order, he disappeared and another waiter tuned up asking the same .we were not sure what happened to our ist order , we were relieved when Bhajias arrived. portion wax very small but ok . for the mains w had to choose from only 3 chicken dishes. So I chose chicken cooked in coconut , maharashtrian style, and my wife orders vegetarian Platter thali. We ordered roti and lemon rice. My chicken had very watery sauce , no taste or flavour , 1 roti was burnt , we were not asked if we wanted butter on it bug it arrived dry lemons rice was good . veg Thali had 2 good vegetable portion and 2 not so good . Again portion was very small. This butler passed by ,and I asked that I was ready off yo beer. He mumbled and said he will bring me beer , did not give me drink menue for me to select but came back with a beef in glass, .not of my taste I drank only half . My chicken and roti was also left as we could nog eat the burnt out roti. By this time we were really disappointed. Had cofffee . Asked for bill. This butler turned up and asked him what had happened to out popadams.? He had no answer , and mumbled that he thought we wouldn't want it as we had ordered bhajias , We're disappointed . Poor quality food and very overpriced. Poor service partly due to over staffing with poor designated roles.

Funny coming from a man and a woman sleeping in seperate beds. Also woke up to hear a dog barking in one of the hotel rooms around ours. You would think a pet friendly hotel would put someone with a dog in an area where no one has a hotel room close to it. And it's overpriced for what you get. This place is convenient as it's attached to the airport but you would be better off going to the airport to eat as this food was average or below. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d8263810-r353800811-The_Westin_Denver_International_Airport-Denver_Colorado.html\n",

The front desk was quickly and easily checking everyone in. All staff was friendly and helpful. We are both constant travellers for business and personal and very picky. The room was fresh and clean. The beds were comfortable. The heating unit was quite and with a full hotel (quite a few young people partying) we experienced a quite peaceful nights sleep. Enjoyed there complimentary breakfast with a good selection. They even had sandwiches for vegetarians. As far as negative reviews on key cards, this seems to be a common annoyance at many hotels. After a couple tries, we were able get the swipe right the first time. Finally, centrally located, 13 mins from downtown Charlotte, many restaurants and a Waffle House with security a few minutes away if you venture in after 1 am.

The issue I had was with the bar staff. I waited over 15 minutes to order a drink! There were plenty of staff around but none who seemed interested in serving drinks! They were either 're stocking the bar, or chatting to friends who had obviously just checked in. Also, we were given a room key that didn't work. This resulted in a 10 minute wait for a new key as there was only one person or reception. The car park although opposite the hotel, belongs to the train station and is expensive. I would put this hotel above a premier inn, in fact is rather stay in a Premier Inn. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186273-d674509-r626033971-Jurys_Inn_Brighton-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html\n",

I book my room many months in advance, and I do enter my Visa to hold the room. The day before our Cruise is to depart, I arrive at the Fort Lauderdale Airport around 7pm after a horrible FULL day of Flying. (They just removed the Max 8's out of the lineup - so flights were a mess). I turn on my phone and call the hotel to ask to have the Shuttle sent - which is on it's way. I then notice I have a voicemail message -it's to call the Holiday Inn Immediately. I called back. They tell me they do not have a room for me as my Visa didn't work, and they were (get this) trying to call me for months. So, the same phone number they just called me on, which worked fine - apparently didn't work for 3 months? They then tell me they booked me a room at another hotel, and I'm to get a shuttle to the Crown Plaza. But if the Visa I gave them, doesn't work, how am I to stay at another hotel with the same Visa? They were not apologetic, kept putting the blame on me. They obviously over-booked and didn't honor my reservation, but didn't have the honesty or integrity to say it. They booked us at the Crown Plaza that was not within walking distance to anywhere, it was in an Industrial area, near the Cruise Port. The Crown Plaza does not offer a free Breakfast or coffee the next morning. Breakfast was 20.00 each, and again, we couldn't walk anywhere!! I would advise anyone staying Pre-Cruise to NOT stay at the Holiday Inn, book elsewhere that will honor a Valid Reservation made months in advance! https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d502999-r669239377-Holiday_Inn_Express_Hotel_Suites_Ft_Lauderdale_Airport_Cruise-Fort_Lauderdale_Brow.html\n",

We were in town for a friend's wedding and originally booked the Charleston Place Hotel, but after seeing the Trip Advisor reviews and roughly $80 total price difference, opted for the FQ Inn. We did visit the lobby and bar of the Charleston Place Hotel twice, but we weren't disappointed with our decision- the FQ Inn was ideally located near the open market and within easy walking distance of everything in the downtown historic district. The staff was friendly, helpful and accomodating, and although we couldn't check into our room early, the complimentary wine and cheese made up for that. We somehow didn't get the free champagne and ladyfingers upon check-in and regret that we weren't able to take advantage of the free and milk and cookies due to our hectic schedule, but we would definitely stay there again. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54171-d225044-r23316889-French_Quarter_Inn-Charleston_South_Carolina.html\n",

I arrived early and waited for my check in time... in the mean time there were random people just hanging out in the hotel parking lot who were definitely not guests of the hotel. I went to call the front desk to ask about the shuttle and realized the phone didn’t work, then picked it up and realized it didn’t even have any cords attached to it. This is where it gets bad... we went to the bar/ restaurant and it was genuinely the worst service I’ve ever had in my life. The bartender took about 20 minutes to take our order, that was after we had to ask her. She only had about 4 customers at the bar. She proceeded to get every drink order wrong and bring the drinks one at a time... 5 minutes apart. No joke. My drink sat empty for 20 minutes a couple times and we saw several people just walk out because they couldn’t get a drink. She genuinely wasn’t that busy. We ordered three lemon drop shots and she first brought us a drink. I told her we wanted shots, and I had to explain how to chill vodka in a shaker because she told us she didn’t have chilled vodka. Then when we brought the shots, they all had ice in them. They also charge you extra if you get pop in your mixed drink. We went to get ice the next morning and the ice machine on the second floor doesn’t work. We went to shower the next morning and there was no hot water. The new aesthetics are not worth the awful service and lack of amenities at this hotel. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d83038-r576480250-Radisson_Denver_Central-Denver_Colorado.html\n",

Pro - The view from the top floor overlooking the coast was fantastic. Cons - The rooms are very dated, in particular the bathroom and 'kitchen' areas. The hotel seems to believe that a touch-up of paint, some coloured info sheets on the desk and internet access in the rooms = a new and attractive room. The bathrooms were dingy and very stale smelling. The room we had was a very odd shape, triangular with an assortment of furniture squeezed into a small space. The male receptionist was rude and disinterested in any matter relating to guests. The location was ok, it took 5 minutes to walk to the Ala Moana mall and around 25 minutes to walk into Waikiki. An ABC (like a 7-11) is closeby for basic provisons. The Equus - which is situated directly in front of the Marina - is a superior property for a cheaper price. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d217486-r11274095-Waikiki_Marina_Resort_at_the_Ilikai-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html\n",

On paying we were rudely informed ‘oops I should have told you we would charge you exactly the same price for the overpriced hotcake (1)’ . The waitress was insincere and rude, in her response stating ‘it’s not a problem’ failing to acknowledge it was in fact ‘a problem’ - $16 for 1 hotcake and honey what a joke- won’t return, won’t recommend, will let friends know not to visit, will tell friends to avoid the rude service!!!!! https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d8702393-r668201184-Petition-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html\n",

      "345935 Well-managed, clean, safe, friendly, resort-like Quality Hotel ---SEP--- A friendly, safe, resort-like, competitively-priced gem in southeastern Phoenix, 10 minutes southeast of Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, with convenient limited-hour airport shuttle. Wi Fi strength, of near university-campus strength, is consistently strong for streaming videos. Rooms with microwave and mini-fridge are efficiently air-conditioned, well maintained and cleaned. For the car-less travellers from the airport, a short 5-minute tech-park neighborhood walk away is a gas-station for beer and convenience-store cuisine. A little farther away are fast-food restaurants and a Safeway grocery store. Guests with vehicle can find dollar stores and many other eateries within a 5-minute drive. The free hot breakfast, with scrambled eggs and breakfast meat, starts a bit earlier and ends a bit later than at most other Quality Hotel properties nationwide. The bountiful buffet items, hot and cold, are enthusiastically replenished by a tireless staff. Front desk staff and the general manager are consistently friendly. In fact, once, on my return to the hotel some months after a stay to bring to the attention of the general manager that the system had billed me for a Choice-points stay (instead of billing Choice rewards), he apologized profusely, and even sweetened the glitch by awarding me many more Choice points than I had “lost.” From this event and from every other aspect of the operation of this hotel, I am impressed with the general can-do atmosphere, which keeps this property, which is at least a couple of decades old, alive and rocking. Two consistently well-functioning treadmills, in a well air-conditioned room facing the pleasantly laid-out swimming pool, can help with the loss of calories involuntarily accrued from the breakfast buffet. Most guests who enter the gym rarely activate the exercise equipment. They tend to the ones who are too shy to cross the street to buy their own bottled water; they just refill their water bottles from the gym's distilled-water dispenser. My most recent stay here occurred in May 2018. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d543136-r597471662-Quality_Inn_Phoenix_Airport-Phoenix_Arizona.html\n",

Housekeeping is great, and if you want coffee pods, towels or anything they are there with in seconds of hanging up the phone, a lovely man comes around door to door every morning offering coffee pods, cups, sugar and milk. Have stayed here twice, only downside is its a little towards the end of Waikiki but the price is with this in mind, its the best option for this price range, have no issues staying here and its directly on the beach, I wouldn't look anywhere else.

Aside from not having a microwave in the room, the rooms are clean and have plenty of room. Had a Queen bed for my wife, myself and our 5yo son and a sofa bed for my 17yo daughter. It was a great place to rest after a long day at Busch Gardens/Tampa. Oh yeah! When we arrived, I asked the host if I might request a fan (as I get hot easily and my wife gets cold); he said he thought he could help and sure enough, someone delivered a fan for us to use. The service is always great with friendly smiles and wonderful personalities. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34678-d87650-r296513854-Hyatt_Place_Tampa_Busch_Gardens-Tampa_Florida.html\n",
      "2925905 A great return! ---SEP--- We haven't been to the Crown Plaza in a good few years, mostly because their prices became ridiculous when the Hydro opened, but it seems they have more competition now which might make us go back a bit more. This was a reward night using our IHG points and we were delighted to find out that we had been upgraded to a suite when we arrived. Now I arrived around midday and the gentleman on reception (I didnt get his name, but he said he was new) managed to get my room ready within 30 minutes, but allowed me to wait in the club lounge until it was ready. The suite was lovely and completely renovated since the last time we stayed here, with tremendous views cross Glasgow. The bathroom had also been done up and it was far better too, probably the best rain shower I have ever had! The beds as always were super comfy and a great nights sleep was had. We seeing James Martin in the Clyde Auditorium and it was great to walk through the hotel into the Armadillo..no need to take big heavy jackets! Before we went to the show we went to the club lounge, which again had been renovated since the last time we were there, but it was good to see that Kevin was still working in the lounge. He is a credit to the hotel and always checked with us that everyhing was ok. The club lounge here is good, but not as good the Hilton. All in all it was a great stay and it made us realised why we used to love this hotel. We will look again when popping up to Glasgow for the night to consider coming back, if the price is right. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186534-d192415-r629589272-Crowne_Plaza_Glasgow-Glasgow_Scotland.html\n",

Check in staff were friendly and very helpful, the same for the checkout staff also. The room was spacious, clean and modern. Our bed was amazing and super comfortable, wish I had one like that at home! A little bit of a bizarre design feature of the hotel that the rooms windows face inside the hotel into the atrium, but we paid for a standard room and I guess the exterior/seafront facing windows are in the premium rooms. This in no way affected the pleasure of our stay, just a note. Breakfast buffet was delicious, varied and well stocked. Despite us coming close to closing time it was still being topped up so really well done for that!! Something seldom seen on a buffet breakfast. There was a fantastic looking healthy buffet available too with fresh smoothies, granolas, fruit and gluten free options. Would have certainly indulged had I not been in a full English state of mind that day!! Would definitely stay again.

If you meet any of the staff they ask you how you are doing, if you need anything, do you need assistance. The room was charming with historical feel. Highly updated with electronic gizmos which was surprising. Lovely turn down service. The breakfast buffet has anything you could want but you can also order from a menu. There are so many activities that you could be busy for a week just trying them all. Walking the grounds is a treat. The gardens are extensive and it is like you have a huge city park to yourself.

      "2922294 Not a good place to stay ---SEP--- This was our 1st stay at Castle Rock & I doubt we ever stay again. The one good thing was David at the front desk. Upon checking in our room we noticed the water was only trickling from the sink when we tried to use it and did not run at all from the shower head. We called front desk & was told maintenance would come check. After waiting to unpack for the next 20 mins we called back down & they were still working on the problem. After another 20 mins I checked the shower & it was working. A call from the front desk would've been nice to let us know 1) they weren't coming to our room & 2) the problem was eventually solved so I could unpack, not a huge deal but still. Finally unpacked & my son found candy wrappers in the top bunkbed & toys which means the room obviously wasn't cleaned well. Also, at night after getting an extra blanket from the drawer a few bugs/spiders were seen crawling up the wall. Plus the bunkbeds weren't set up well as the bottom bunk couldn't even see the tv from how it was mounted on the wall. Let's get to the real reason we booked the room, the water park. It was horribly cold, water was freezing, our kids wouldn't even stay in for more than 30 mins. The kiddie pool was so ice cold even the lifeguard told was shocked at the coldness. Plus when you tried to talk to a lifeguard they would just keep walking and barely acknowledge you. We spoke to multiple hotel employees about the water temperature and it was never corrected. The water never warmed up even at 9 pm at night. We paid for something we weren't even able to use. Highly disappointed in this hotel and so were my kids. I am currently checking out earlier because of this. I hope these issues are addressed before others get duped into staying because of the water park and instead get a pool that feels like an ice bath. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d1163505-r326651080-Castle_Rock_Resort_Waterpark-Branson_Missouri.html\n",

      "1066235 BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY IN THE HAWKES BAY VINES ---SEP--- We had a 30th celebration in our family so nine of us headed for Hawkes Bay some flying and some by car. The road trip from Auckland is around five hours with stops via Lake Taupo and some spectacular and quintessential New Zealand highway driving and flying is 45 minutes from Auckland domestic airport. Millar Road is a group of three buildings set in a vineyard on a ridge overlooking vines that stretch down to forests and the sea. The main house consists of 3 generous bedrooms with king beds one ensuited and the other two sharing a bathroom complex and bath. The house stretches along the ridge so every room has a grand view with all amenities situated to the rear. The beds and linen were crisp and delightful with generous cupboard space and the main bedroom had a walk in robe. A large fully functioning kitchen flows to a dining space and then onto a living room with a log fireplace and study off to one side separating the kitchen from the master bedroom is another large study. A long salty pool then sits to one side between the main house and the next building which is a standalone house with two king bedrooms two bathrooms with a shared bath area. In front of the bedroom area is a generous kitchen dining space and living area. We took these two buildings and the third structure is similar to the latter with another two bedrooms but is totally isolated and we never saw anyone from there although we believe there was an American couple staying. We spent four days and four nights here and loved every minute ... We cooked one night and had a wonderful catered dinner from Paolo for the birthday night and then ate out at Craggy Range ... Sublime! ... and had pizas on the last night ... Our days were lying in the sun playing Cub on the massive lawn by the vines swimming in the pool and visiting some of the best wineries that NZ has to offer ... This included a biking wine trail that took most of one day ending in a long lazy lunch under vines at Clear View estate just down from the amazing Elephant winery ... Our hosts were brilliant and all our needs were taken care of and it was nice to do some laundry after long days playing in the sun ... The only issue was understanding the lighting system as there were just so many switches! ... A special mention to Paolo Pancotti the principal of Molto Italian Kitchen who cooked for us ... It was a wonderful meal that was perfect for the celebration and he produced this with fresh vegetables and locally caught John Dory as a main ... He is brilliant and thoroughly recommended ... The house also has a massive herb garden and a bountiful fig tree! ... So if you are a couple or a group of up to 14 couples looking for relaxation and wine tours this is a great spot ... https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255680-d1422334-r659724110-Millar_Road-Hastings_Hawke_s_Bay_Region_North_Island.html\n",

      "2766961 Very good, but not great ---SEP--- I stayed at the Blu Aqua and ate at this, the hotel restaurant, two nights in a row. The first night, I ate by myself in the hotel bar. It was comfortable and a really nice space yet good for solo dining. The bar menu is completely different from the restaurant menu. I had an excellent mushroom and spinach pizza, with a really good specialty cocktail. Very noisy, though The following evening, I dined in the restaurant upstairs. Much quieter, and an equally comfortable space. Nice menu, although ultimately a little strange. The menu would have you think the place is very Italian, but one of the starters and one of the pasta dishes were not at all. The pasta portions were generous, although it was weird that my colleague's bowl of ravioli was much smaller than our dishes of pasta. I had the orecchiete, which was mistakenly described on the menu as corkscrew pasta ... as served it actually was orecchiete, tiny bowl-shaped bits of pasta (the name means \"little ears\"). But it was billed as coming with seared tuna, actually it was in a light tomato sauce with cubes of raw tuna, and very bright herbs. So the cold tuna on the hot pasta was strange (and not the was the Italians would do it), and the bright herbs overpowered the flavor of the sauce. It was perfectly good, but as I say not authentic and just kind of weird. My colleagues both really enjoyed their dishes though. I had a carpaccio appetizer, which was delicious but a tiny portion. My colleague had the saumon tartare, which was served on guacamole. Quite delicious, but again not authentic. I guess I'm being too much of a purist. If you like good food you'll love it but you'll mark it down if you're expecting \"real\" Italian. The wine list was quite good by the way. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d2646856-r301972839-Filini_Bar_and_Restaurant-Chicago_Illinois.html\n",
      "1528956 Excellent Stay - Difficult to get to if you are driving! ---SEP--- Had an excellent 2 night stay recently at this Hilton hotel. I was booked in a king room. The room was really spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable. Excellent service from all the staff members. The leisure facilities were good at the hotel too. They had a decent sized gym, a sauna, steam, Jacuzzi and swimming pool. Breakfast was good too. The only let down was this hotel is really difficult to get to, with flyovers on both sides and a motorway in the middle. Staff said this is a common problem reported by many guests. Once there, the hotel had ample parking space. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186534-d192416-r440975715-Hilton_Glasgow-Glasgow_Scotland.html\n",

      "1016354 Iconic hotel, worth a stay for the Victorian charm. ---SEP--- *The* iconic Quebec hotel, it is on what seems like every postcard and image of the city. Built in the late 1800s -- despite its name it was never a castle, it was purpose built as a hotel, and got its shape through stages -- you can still see the late Victorian charm. What that translates to in practical terms is large and detailed public spaces and smaller rooms (or at least for the basic rooms), slow elevators, small windows (unlike some, I did have a bit of a view of the river and the citadel). Room had everything you needed. Note, though, no free bottle of water in this hotel. And the mini bar sensor trips if you touch anything in the fridge. (The mini-fridge is entirely taken up by the mini bar drinks, so no room if you want to put your own drinks in). Did not experience most of the hotel amenities, I was there on a tight turn around business trip. I did use the gym once. It was adequate for the hotel, on the same level as the indoor pool, which made it a bit humid. It had limited hours, however, closing at 9pm in the evening. Free plug in internet in the rooms, but not free wifi. Location is fantastic, right in the old city. Walkable to anywhere you want to go, the funicular down to the lower town is right out the door. The Citadel and the Fields of Abraham are maybe a 15 minute walk away (admittedly, I am a quickish walker). It is a touristy area, with a variety of food selections. As I was there for a conference, we got a special rate (that was better with the Canadian exchange). I probably would not pay the full rate to stay there on leisure, but I am a bargain hunter for hotels. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155033-d155587-r300030461-Fairmont_Le_Chateau_Frontenac-Quebec_City_Quebec.html\n",
      "2905779 Awesome motel units ---SEP--- We stayed in a 2 bedroom motel unit for a few days and it was fantastic. As part of a 2 week holiday in the south island this was by far the best accommodation we stayed in. The unit was massive, almost the size of a small house. It seems to be very new and modern with great facilities. We like staying at Top 10's as they have extra features that other motels don't have, like playgrounds for the kids, ours were obsessed with the garden chess set. As far as a Top 10 goes, this isn't the biggest or most fully equipped, but as a motel is was awesome. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255120-d664440-r467376010-Invercargill_TOP_10_Holiday_Park-Invercargill_Southland_Region_South_Island.html\n",

We started with crab meat, stuffed oysters, which were a huge portion, though too sauced up. I got a New York strip, which had a good flavor, but was nothing special and overdone. A side of green beans was excellent.

      "892613 Overpriced and under whelmed!! ---SEP--- We called castaways and informed them there were 4 adults and one baby so needed 2 bedrooms, we were told this was available and we booked. When we arrived we were so disappointed, the supposed 2 bedroom family room was nothing more then a bed in the front room and another separate bedroom. Which clearly was not what we were told. The rooms smelt of mildew the only positive was the views. When we went down to reception to complain about the room not being as we was told, we were informed, that there was a wedding and all the rooms were full so nothing they could do. So we went back to our room disappointed. Next morning we had breakfast, and was told there was at least a 40 minute wait as there was a wedding!!! Surely they know they have a wedding and should therefore cater for this by having extra staff ensuring their other guests do not suffer, this was not the case. Would not recommend! https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g499675-d498171-r169548993-Castaways_Resort_Spa_Mission_Beach-Mission_Beach_Queensland.html\n",

The location next to the beach is just amazing, especially if you like to go and have a swim a few times a day. You can virtually arrive and not have to use the car again because the location of the hotel is next to all the attractions of Noosa and Hastings street. If you are looking to save some money, the rooms on Hastings Street are just as good, although you don't always get a room with a water view. All the staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful.

      "3048302 Rather a Surprise ---SEP--- Looking for a quick set lunch menu, with two courses at £18 pp, expectations were not high. They were well exceeded and, indeed, it's been a long time since I've given a restaurant 'Five dots'. The quality of the food (my wife's Mackerel Pate with Sour Dough Bread, my Oysters, and our Oven Roasted Sea Bream Filets with champ mashed potato and basil pesto) was superb (and the latter brought to the table hot, which doesn't always happen in busy restaurants) - as good as any fish restaurant in London. I judge a restaurant by whether or not I would return and the answer here is 'Certainly' - and I'll try their branch in Marylebone too. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1421098-r631994130-FishWorks_Swallow_Street-London_England.html\n",
      "1909408 Decent Hotel, Indifferent Staff, Safety Concerns ---SEP--- I was in town for a conference held at this hotel. A block of rooms were reserved at a fair price. The hotel was very decent: comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, all the amenities you may need. The staff was, at best, indifferent. During the stay there were a few bizarre run-ins with the front desk clerks and with middle-management. (Nothing remarkable just odd interactions.) But, the one worth sharing here involves a band of seemingly homeless people sleeping in the stairwell of the hotel. Because the elevators were not functioning efficiently, I took the stairs from the 16th floor to the ground level but was interrupted between the eighth and the ninth floor by people sleeping in the stairwell. This was quite frightening as I was trapped in the stairwell and had to jog up the stairs to get back out. Upon notifying management of this they were very apologetic but didn't seem all together surprised. And they didn't seem to take immediate action ... indicating that the security guard should have arrived earlier that morning, but that no one had seen him yet It was dropped and no further communication took place. Needless to say, I avoided the stairs the rest of the trip. Likewise, I will avoid this hotel when visiting Indianapolis. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d88175-r317886453-Sheraton_Indianapolis_City_Centre_Hotel-Indianapolis_Indiana.html\n",

The service was terrible, we waited half an hour for our drinks to arrive and a further half an hour for the food to arrive.

Location was great, about a 15 minute walk from the main drag of Melbourne CBD, so well away from all the nighttime noise and activity associated with that, but still close enough to plenty of things. Upon check-in, with a very friendly staff member, we were generously given a room upgrade to a suite on the 20th floor. The room was magnificent! We entered to room to be greeted by the spectacular sight of the setting sun reflecting off the skyscrapers gathered up in front of us. Utterly beautiful. We couldn't believe our luck. A comfortable lounge area, well-equipped kitchenette with coffee machine and full-size fridge/freezer, crisp white bathroom with large shower enclosure, comfortable bedroom and office(!) which was basically a second bedroom but with desk, chair and shelves instead of bedroom furniture. This floor also provided access to an executive lounge, which was available to use during the daytime. It provided seating, coffee facilities, newspapers, and a glorious outdoor terrace to maximise this spectacular views. Breakfast was good. Plenty of choice, and a particularly friendly chef who was positively brimming with enthusiasm and eagerness to please. We didn't really make the most of the front of house staff, as we tended to make our own plans and dash out past them, but they were always there with a smile and friendly greeting. We'd really recommend this place if you want to be central, but not right on the doorstep of all the action, and are happy to walk a bit to get to places. Tram stops were only a little over 5 minutes away. One little tip: be careful not to lean on the buttons in the lift. There are 4 sets of buttons in each lift, taking up a large proportion of the wall space, and it's VERY easy to accidentally press a whole selection of random floors with your bag or elbow, resulting in a rather extended climb to your floor!! https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d3686304-r485020306-Pegasus_Apart_Hotel-Melbourne_Victoria.html\n",

      "555672 I will never stay here again! ---SEP--- Let me start off by saying that this is a beautiful resort. I check out tomorrow. I have been here three times and have referred my friends and colleagues who have also patronized this resort. I have always been treated well and had a great experience. However, this time my trip was ruined before I checked in. I will NEVER come back here! I’m an attorney with a boutique firm in the greater Atlanta area. I brought my family and some of my employees on a get away here. There were 17 of us in total. (Almost $2500 just for rooms, before we spend money). I booked several rooms and I used the Government rate. The lady that checked me in (Tyshale who proclaimed to be a manager) was the rudest person I have ever encountered. Her first statement to me after good afternoon was I see you have over two rooms booked at the government rate, we can only honor two of the rooms. Sorry. I was like excuse me. Then she goes through this entire ceremony at an elevated tone telling me how they can’t honor my rate that I booked 6 months prior. She went so far as to start cutting me off and told me to step behind the counter so she can show me where it says only two rooms. Just being real extra, then she started failing her arms about to prove her point. I have never! Finally when I asked her why she was doing that and could I speak to the manager she says I’m the manager and I said I know it’s someone over you. She says her manager is on a conference call. She then says she would honor the rate. Then I tell her I’m a reward member and we are celebrating (which usually means an upgrade if they are available) she tells me she is happy for me. So I ask her are there any upgrades and she tells me that I have the government rate. Mind you I was the only African American in the line at the time. I was so embarrassed and humiliated. I was like wow ok. It seems as though bad manners are a Practice of this resort, the staff is dismissive and will run you over if you are not careful, all while not speaking. Some were very friendly. My room smells like they mopped the floor with a dirty mop but I was too spent to say anything because when my sister called the front desk to see about another room they told her she was booked at the Government rate! I just could not believe it. Like they don’t get a friends and family rate when they book. I heard another customer complaining about seeing a roach and the response was this is a tropical place, smh. If you want to go and spend a couple of thousand dollars and be treated unceremoniously by all means this is the place for you. I’m telling all my friends and professional colleagues about this experience. I could type more but I will tell you the food is kinda over priced but convenient and it taste ok, the parking was over priced $39 a night but they tell you that, the resort fee is a joke in my opinion but you know that before you book. Hope this helps someone! Marriott Do better. Don’t lose good paying customers because your staff is poorly trained! https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d84476-r678046637-Fort_Lauderdale_Marriott_Harbor_Beach_Resort_Spa-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Flo.html\n",

Note to travelers, our first experience with the new Best Western Logo and we never recognized the tall sign visible from the highway. Still used to the older version. Not sure that change was necessary but now we know. This hotel was far superior to our experience a few years ago at a BW Columbus north.

I inadvertently on my way down to denver from the Mountains called a third party to book my room. I understand the third party process. The old Hyatt Class Brand would refund my money and let me leave. I had not been in the room for more than 15 minutes when I was clear I did not want to stay the night. The manager would not come out to speak with me, I left a voice message around 5 and another when I returned to my room around 10:00. I still have not received a call back from them.

I stayed during the film fleadh when it was really busy. I couldnt fault the staff or service as despite being really busy , we always felt looked after. The room was spacious, hotel relaxing and plenty of choice in restaurant anytime of the day. Food was a bit pricey in the bar but service excellent and quality also. HOWEVER. most impressive was after having checked out, I left and my friend that I had stayed with got stranded in the car park. It was torrential rain and miserable and she had a 3hr journey ahead of her. Her battery was dead and she was starting to panic. NO NEED. She went back to reception and they calmed her down and they sent someone to help her immediately. The perfect end to a great few days in Galway.

It's very close to Mascot station and food places and a Woolworths. It's conveniently placed and doesn't feel like it takes too long to get to central or circular quay. The rooms have a very good air conditioning unit, this really is a must in Australian summer so it's great to have that.

      "1396266 desk clerks don't have a clue and computer system needs updated ---SEP--- We had a reservation for 4 rooms for 3 nights for a family vacation. 3 of the 4 families checked in on the first night. The 4th family didn't check in until the 2nd night due to travel times. Unfortunately the desk clerk Heather and the lovely system couldn't find the 3 families already checked in and tried to tell the 4th family that we were not even staying there. This led to a lot of frustration for the 4th family. They decided ţo stay there anyway in another room that was available. The 4th family texted us about the problem with the hotel system. When we finally got back from sightseeing, we had to complain to Heather about the issue. She couldn't do anything for us until the morning when her manager came in. The 4th family had to move from one room to the original room that we had reserved for them. This was a horrible experience for all involved. The computer system needs to be corrected to find a guest's name regardless of when they checked in. .. If that guest is in a room for that day it should show up when their name is typed in whether they checked in the night before or that day. They really didn't solve the problem to all of our satisfaction. They really should give my father (the one who paid for all 4 rooms) a much greater discount.

I've worked in hospitality, but before our food arrived I said to my partner that she is one of the best servers in London. When the food arrived, we weren't disappointed. The food is traditional, authentic Greek. It doesn't try to be fancy. It is real Greek food, done in a real Greek way. We rarely go back to the same place to eat, but we will be back here.

However I was disappointed after that. Sure its a steak house but at lunch time not every one wants a 1kg slab of red meat! The menu needed some lighter options and I noticed in particular that some of the ladies in our group were overwhelmed by the menu. What was really annoying were the waiting staff. They need to go back to waitress school as they were so intrusive, barging into conversations as opposed to hanging an back and waiting for the right to moment to pour wine or enquire how our food was. It became really quite irritating. What was also annoying was being told that a particular desert on the menu was sticky toffee and found it instead to be some custard tart. I think this was because the Waitress did not speak English very well. I was also surprised that the kitchen staff kept walking through the dining area in their dirty aprons carrying boxes and plates. Very unprofessional. So, all in all, for the amounts charged for lunch I was unimpressed sadly. Waiting Staff really need to up their games very significantly. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d733233-r194128711-Gillray_s_Steakhouse_Bar-London_England.html\n",

      "1936329 Short and Sweet ---SEP--- We had the pleasure of a short stay here and would definitely return for a longer one! Initial reception was friendly and informative, room clean and quite updated and we were offered a nicer room with a nicer view without asking! The in-house restaurant is where this hotel shines as the Dimitri the waiter was very professional, informative and lovely and kind from the moment he first came to our table. As well the food and drinks were all excellent and the next morning we met Melania and she was very friendly too. I can say the restaurant staff go 'above and beyond' to ensure you are comfortable and happy, again even if it's for a very short time. There was a little mix up upon our departure with our ride, which was very quickly resolved by the manager, without us even having to mention it.

      "737589 Good business hotel ---SEP--- Stayed one night for business. Reception quick and easy. Stayed in one bedroom on third floor which was really a hotel room with a kitchenette. Clean, very comfortable bed, great pressure in the shower spray. Free undercover parking. Have to pay additional to access wireless internet. 24 hr reception but I was never able to get them to pick up phone, had to go down. Windows must be really thin as room was very cold in evening and takes a while for room to heat up. Heater turns off when not in room. Also Noise carries from adjacent lane as I was woken up before 5am by workers chatting and equipment. Family operated restaurant on site. Recommend the tapas menu for dinner that is really a dinner menu and size at reasonable price. Breakfast gd and service by the girls is very friendly and efficient. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255314-d1200988-r210829645-Quest_Albury-Albury_New_South_Wales.html\n",

Everything was done with a smile. The design of the hotel is warm and very southwestern. I arrived at the hotel around 11am and they checked us in immediately. Our room was on the 17th floor and featured wonderful views of downtown. I have no complaints about the room. It was very clean and maintained. There are a couple of options for parking. You can either use their valet service or self park in their garage next door. The garage had controlled entry and was relatively safe. I didn’t have any issues at all. Due to the close proximity of the sports venues and restaurants the hotel was in a great part of town. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I would easily come here again and again. I recommend this hotel to anyone venturing to the Valley of the sun. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d73855-r558879007-Hyatt_Regency_Phoenix-Phoenix_Arizona.html\n",

I am surprised that this major shortcoming was ever allowed in the first place.

Ordered The Misono Excellence which was supposed to consist of scallops, steak and \"Bugs\" (lobster). The chef asked how we wanted our steak and I tried to get him to explain how the meat would be prepared as steak can bite prepared very differently. He wouldn't answer as he was busy in the show and it was very noisy. My wife ordered well done based upon her previous experience in the hotels other restaurant. In this place, medium = well done and well done = inedible. The order was confused and no scallops were forthcoming, only salmon that we didn't order. They scurried to find some more scallops but meanwhile were cooking another persons scallops. They served all of the scallops at the same time so ours had 10 minutes less on the grill and obviously were raw. We then asked about the rice that supposed to come with the dinner: Oops, we forgot and brought us it after we were finished. After some complaining to the manager, who just didn't seem to understand our problem, she took $50 off our $250 bill. I am not sure how this restaurant gets such high rating, we ate ala cartel at Citrique and it is far superior. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255072-d722316-r455570831-Misono_Japanese_Steakhouse-Surfers_Paradise_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html\n",

The first tacos arrived quickly but they obviously forgot the 2nd ones as we had to ask and it took 20 mins to arrive even though the restaurant wasn't full. We then ordered a simple dessert which took a further 25 minutes to arrive and I had to get up and go a find a server to remind them.

We were in a two-storey villa type unit with a kitchen and living area downstairs and 2 bedrooms and bathroom and separate toilet upstairs. The place was very clean and looked out onto the swimming pool. The beds were very comfortable and although it was a freezing night the unit was quite comfortable even though we couldn't get the air-conditioning to work. The only down side is that the bedroom facing the pool could not get very dark as the room has shutters and there were lights on all night highlighting the pool area. My suggestion - take an eye mask. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We did not eat at any of the venues as we were attending a family special event. The location is quite central.

Firstly, we paid $115 with CAA discount (less than what Super 8 charged). Secondly, the desk clerk was professional, friendly with a good sense of humour. Although this is not a new hotel and somewhat dated in areas, it gives the impression of being grander than it is. Our kids enjoyed the pool area which was well maintained. Unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to dine at the restaurant however it appeared quite inviting. The room was relatively large, clean and the beds were comfortable.

      "2047323 Best kept secret in Edinburgh ---SEP--- Nira Caledonia is one of the Small Luxury Hotels and one of only two listed for Scotland. It is a venue that has not forgotten that they exist to serve customers and they do this in a fashion I had long feared extinct. The service is impeccable, the staff friendly, and everyone was most helpful. Although our room faced the main street in front of the hotel, it was incredibly quiet. I first thought that double-glazing or soundproofing had been applied, but it is simply a quiet location. Every amenity and service was provided. The hotel was within walking distance of nearly everything on our itinerary and taxis were readily available for longer trips. The restaurant, Blackwell's, was excellent, and the service there was also above reproach. I simply cannot say enough good things about this hotel and it will certainly be at the top of our list for a venue when we return to Edinburgh. What a great little hotel! It's a gem among small hotels and the location in Stockbridge could not have been better for us. If you are looking for an example of what luxury hotel service should be, then Nira Caledonia is the right place to stay in Edinburgh. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186525-d590114-r432739390-Nira_Caledonia-Edinburgh_Scotland.html\n",
      "1546871 Great hotel and location ---SEP--- We stayed at this hotel for a week in Wellington and after being used to \"Travelodges\" in Europe, I wasn't expecting much (Just to add, this isn't the same company, just the same name). The hotel is located right in the centre of town, and is only a few minutes walk to the harbour and there are plenty of places around to grab food or a drink. The cable car is nearby and also highly recommended. The staff where very friendly and helpful, and always greeted us with a smile. We never ate in the hotel, as there was too much to explore in Wellington, and prices seemed quite high. The room was big and very well equipped. It had an excellent shower, big TV, fridge and nice comfortable bed. The view out of the window wasn't particularly great (i.e. Just looking at an office block), but I've heard there are rooms with better views. The room was quiet (Although I could hear the neighbour sometimes in the toilet), it was always good to come back and relax in the room after a long day. I would have happily given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the following things: - Lack of Free WiFi. There are other hotels in the area which are cheaper and offer free WiFi. The cost was also quite high, so I purchased a simcard with fast Internet from the Vodafone shop nearby and used that instead. - Charged movies on the TV. Not too bothered about this, since we're not here to sit and watch TV. But, again, when smaller and cheaper hotels can provide free movie channels, I'm not sure why this place couldn't either. Overrall, I would happily stay here again and recommend it. It's not the cheapest of places, but the location is fantastic and the staff are very nice. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d256498-r235660645-Travelodge_Hotel_Wellington-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Island.html\n",

      "1241723 Living on past glories ---SEP--- I chose the hotel because I was travelling solo by train and needed to keep it simple once I got to Glasgow with the heavy luggage I had. And this is one of those grand Victorian hotels—and certainly architecturally magnificent—attached to the main station. No problems getting there, the location for the vibrant centre of Glasgow cannot be bettered. Sadly the same is not true of the hotel. Many reviews here has said their room was small. That was not my problem. It was big, the bed was big, but the furniture was cheap and very limited: hardly any hanging space, no drawers and, most extraordinary in a hotel this expensive, no mini-bar or fridge. Every other hotel I've stayed in of this price has usually had a coffee maker, and often free bottled water. The worst problem, though, was the noise. Whether my room or floor is awaiting renovation, I don't know—all a bit dark and old-fashioned, so perhaps—but the high windows, set in the roof, though an elegant feature, need replacing or, if there are planning restrictions, double/secondary glazed to help with the noise that kept me awake all night every night. If it wasn't construction work and lorries it was Glasgow's famous nightlife, plus general traffic. I knew it was a busy centre-city location but not that the windows would be so inappropriate. I opted for a superior room rather than the basic—so certainly not the top rate—and on three nights out of my five, I played £330 a night without breakfast and for just one person. For that, I expect a lot more. (As a comparison, a vastly superior stay these last three days in the heart of London was luxurious, quiet, wonderfully equipped, and under £200 a night on one of London's busiest weekends). I was asked on check-out if I'd enjoyed my stay and I commented on the noise. The response was simply \"Oh you had a room facing the road\". Well yes, and for this price, perhaps you should attempt to alleviate the problem... or even try saying sorry? https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186534-d1874829-r332539930-Grand_Central_Hotel-Glasgow_Scotland.html\n",

      "616872 A bad start but still a great stay ---SEP--- I have given this a 3-star rating for a variety of reasons. I should preface this by saying that the issue I had has been resolved (sort of) but it still needs to be mentioned. On Friday, February 21st 2020 my partner and I arrived at the Sofitel Darling Harbour at 5 pm only to be advised that our room was not yet ready and they could not tell me when it would be ready. This caused a great deal of inconvenience as my partner had to change and go to a function. He had to change at the venue. I requested to speak with a manager and eventually, Juan arrived. He explained that he could not tell me when the room would be ready or why the delay. He also could not offer me another room as he had none available. He offered us a 4 pm check out and a bottle of wine. He also said he would look at a room rate discount. Eventually, the room became available. The room was well-presented with sweeping views of Darling Harbour and a brief glimpse of the Harbour Bridge. Everyone at the hotel was helpful. We had booked a room that gave us access to Club Millésime. This was a treat for my partner. The staff in Club Millésime were attentive but unintrusive. The only complaint that I would have about Club Millésime was the minimalist canapes that were available for the evening. Despite the initial issues, the stay was enjoyable and relaxing. Upon checking out we found that no discount had been applied. The reception person spoke with Juan who advised that he would offer us a $100 discount and that the minibar items would be deducted from that so we would be getting a refund of $85. I was not impressed. Juan came out and spoke with us and wiped the minibar and said the $100 would be refunded. Still waiting for the $100 refund some 6 days later. Despite all of this it was an enjoyable weekend in a comfortable room with a view. Treat yourself to a weekend away and enjoy the Sofitel. I would, however, strongly suggest that you call the hotel as you are nearing them to ascertain if your room is actually available. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d11687464-r747812687-Sofitel_Sydney_Darling_Harbour-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html\n",

Other than the noise issue, the room has a pleasing decor and is very nice overall for what it is. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d114326-r192908514-Hyatt_Place_Denver_Cherry_Creek-Denver_Colorado.html\n",

Best Western is usually a good chain, plus it was close to restaurants, etc. After our second attempt to stay in a place with a pool and hot tub we learned for our next stay to ASK. They were not working. Hotel was clean and comfortable and price was on par to what we like to pay. Breakfast was in a restaurant on site, so we had to pay. French toast was on French bread, but very thick with just the outside dipped and cooked, the inside was white bread that was hard to cut....I had to ask for a steak knife to cut it. I should have insisted on something else to eat....my mistake. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g154929-d182104-r315822276-Best_Western_Cowichan_Valley_Inn-Duncan_Cowichan_Valley_Regional_District_Vancouv.html\n",

This hotel is beautiful, the room we stayed in was exceptionally clean, stunning bathroom, and just all-around a wonderful place to stay. Where we stayed the laundry room, ice machine, and vending machine were on the other side of the hall, which was very convenient after the long road-trip we've had. I thought they would be noisy, but you can't hear them at all, the walls are very thick in-between. I have one complaint about the ice machine, the directions on how to use it aren't clear, we had to finally ask someone, and they showed us... it's easy once you know, but the directions don't show the last step properly. The staff at Coast High Country Inn are very friendly and knowledgeable. Overall, a wonderful stay at this Inn. Location: Downtown Whitehorse Parking: medium - there is a decent amount of parking available, but not a lot Price: A bit pricier, but worth it, it's a lovely hotel.

Nice clean rooms if a little small (especially the shower) but at least a nice comfortable bed which was a bonus for a good nights sleep. Hidding away in Sutton Forest so don't miss the turn to get into the place. Good service from the staff when we checked in and booked out. Would be interesting to stay for longer to really get the feel for the place but it looked nice, shame we did not get chance to try the golf course. Basically it did the job which was required and the best part was the comfy bed, the worst would be the size and power of the shower. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g580477-d287265-r474397915-Peppers_Manor_House-Sutton_Forest_Southern_Highlands_New_South_Wales.html\n",

We ate three times at the restaurant - once with friends a week before we checked in to the hotel and a dinner and breakfast on our return.

      "79791 Unfriendly: why do people choose to be rude? ---SEP--- I booked this particular hotel based on the large amount of 4 star reviews. People must have really low expectations. The positives, 1. Clean and 2. Comfortable bed. The negatives, 1. Rude reception at check in, something we didn’t need after a 2 hr delay at 2:45 AM and 2. Second bed not made and 3. The rude lady at reception when I asked about the unmade bed and 4. Too far from the airport. Yes, clean is very important but just a little common decency from the people working at this hotel would go a long way. Why this woman made a conscious choice to look upon my family as an irritating burden when we were nothing but polite and courteous to her I just don’t understand. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d10586814-r685874782-Home2_Suites_by_Hilton_Denver_International_Airport-Denver_Colorado.html\n",

One evening we left the dining room having waited in vain to be offered tea or coffee.

You can tell that Sam (the owner) has spent many hours taking care of and improving the property. The courtyard with pool is very clean with lots of chairs and loungers. Sam takes pride in the property as he has lots of beautiful flower adorning every corner of the property. The views of the mountains from the courtyard area are stunning too. There is a bbq available if you want to cook and stay in. Our room was clean and the beds were amazingly comfortable. Had the best sleep on our trip here. The bathroom was bright and has been recently renovated. The lodge is in close proximity to the downtown core, allowing one to stroll the town easily.

Manager to get upstairs and a table to hear the live piano and singer. The atmosphere is dark and intimate with the feeling of Paris without the smoke. The furniture is a mismatch is peices and looks great but for someone tall found the chairs uncomfortably and reminded me of a bad 1920s cinema seat as hard and the wrong hight. Did find it steep that you pay for the bread and butter and only get 1 small peice. Foe gras was disapointing as didn't go with the white bread. For the main the food was really filling and shared a cassoulet loved it. For desert I struggled to get anything as most had nuts again or cooked fruit. Although they managed to find a creme brulee without cooked fruit added so over the moon. Wine wise don't have the French reds at the top as no depth in taste go to the bottom of the page and get the £34 red as this was perfect and wish we had this for our first bottle.

A couple of small things to note about this hotel...the in room TV programming and internet can be very frustrating as they are both very slow and pretty archaic to today's standard. Another note is that about the lounge and restaurant...the food leaves a lot to be desired and really is not good at all. There are many good restaurants popping up in the area that are walking distance from the hotel so you will have options. The lounge has a very weird set-up and atmosphere and again does not offer much.

Bathroom clean but again tiny. Really far too small to be offered as a twin room. I was expecting a small room with the word cosy in the title but didn't think it was possible to pay for such a tiny room. Would be ideal as a single room or for children. Also had a flicking light so couldn't really use the lights with out getting s headache. This was tried to be sorted but after one was fixed the other light started, and that was after the maintenance guys had left, Very glad we only booked for two nights as I don't think I could have stayed much longer, it was nice weather outside but not too hot and room was very stuffy, window left open at all times, the little fan given helped but was the first thing you put on when you entered. Spa was beautifully set out but was set at a far too high temperature in the larger hydrotherapy pool. Dressing gown and slippers a lovely touch. The first night no swimming pool but luckily this was ready for the second day, and was lovely and cool. We felt very confined and hot in the relaxing areas though. Staff were lovely, spa and hotel. Breakfast was busy and a bit chaotic but worth it in the end. Please consider if you are booking this room as a twin room for adults as I must admit travel lodge around the corner might have been more suitable ( and half the price) wasn't spacious enough to be a relaxing room to come back too more like a place to sleep overnight only. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186273-d192535-r513542763-Brighton_Harbour_Hotel_Spa-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html\n",

The site seemed very busy with very few empty pitches. Each field has its own large toilet/ shower block. The toilet/shower blocks were always clean and tidy no matter what time of day we visited. The water of the shower was at a good temperature, although you \"get what your given\" for the water temperature. There is no way of user adjusting the temperature. Only criticism of the showers is the shower heads are fixed and are slightly too low. I'm 5'10 and it was about neck height for me. Shop was well stocked. Prices were inconsistent- some items were cheaper than found at the nearby Tesco, whereas other items were very expensive. Bar prices were reasonable- £3.40 for a pint of Orchards Cider, £1.50 for a coke. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The site is in the middle of nowhere which we rather liked. No mobile signal. The site has complimentary WiFi, although this was pretty much unusable due to a lack of bandwidth for a site of this size. I found the only time it worked well enough to use was about 6am-8am when many other campers were still sleeping.

      "810162 One Night Stay ---SEP--- My wife and I stayed at the Strathcona Hotel last night as we needed somewhere to crash for the night after a night out with some friends. We found the hotel online and noticed the very reasonable rates for a downtown Toronto hotel. We definitely were not expecting anything fancy as we simply needed somewhere to sleep for the night. Overall, the room was clean, exactly the way it looks on their website. However, there were a couple of minor things like the wall paper starting to peel off the wall where it meets the ceiling, the walls not being thick enough or insulated enough to prevent sound from other rooms and we had a little bit of difficulty operating the temperature control but these were really minor things to us. With all of this being said, these were really minor things to us due to the purpose of our stay. The room was definitely one of the smallest rooms I have stayed in as the queen size bed took up a lot of room and the bathroom was extremely small. Once again, these were not major concerns to us but could understand why they may be to others. We didn't have any problems with the staff as they were friendly and no different than any other hotel. We took a quick look at the breakfast buffet and decided to pass at it didn't look too appealing. However, there is a Tim Hortons right across the street and other restaurants and coffee shops near by. Be prepared to walk a little after you find a place to park as the parking next door was closed and we had to park about a block away. Overall, I would say this is an average hotel that is great if you need somewhere to stay for a night or two for a very reasonable price. I would recommend this hotel to young couples, singles and students visiting Toronto. We would definitely stay here again if we needed a place to sleep for the night.

We booked our trip through Expedia and also got a room-category upgrade and free parking for being Expedia VIP members. Our room was on the bottom floor near the breakfast room, and was actually pretty quiet. I will say this from looking through open doors into the regular queen rooms - they seemed more spacious than my king room with Jacuzzi bath....it was pretty cramped in there, though very clean and well-appointed. Loved the furnishings. I hit a tree my second day skiing and spent the rest of my vacation in the hotel while hubby skied - and the staff at the hotel could not have been nicer or more accommodating. They truly seemed to feel bad for me, even offering to bring me ice packs to my room! Location was wonderful - never needed to drive a night to go to dinner - plenty within walking distance.

A lot better than the usual cave man diet (Tuna pasta and chicken and rice) I live off day to day. %100 recommend this place and it wasn’t overly pricey either https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d4096822-r576351242-The_Grain_Store-Melbourne_Victoria.html\n",
      "1057191 Left feeling slightly disappointed... ---SEP--- Just came back from a late lunch visit at Arabica bar & kitchen and needless to say I feel slightly disappointed. First let me start with the positives - Drink menu is really great. We were sat by the bar and the guy who served us was very friendly and knowledgeable. The variety they offer is great. Unfortunately that is where the positives end.... The food was very avaergae apart from the squid. We ordered 5 dishes (pictures attached) all over priced and not outstanding. As a whole I would visit again for drinks and maybe some dip to go alongside! https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d6845113-r262299587-Arabica_Bar_Kitchen-London_England.html\n",

      "673381 Great cabins on roaring river ---SEP--- Becker’s Chalet is a great place to stay while in Jasper. My wife and I spent 2 nights here in July. Only about 2 miles from town, sits along the magnificent Alabaster River, and is directly off the highway as you leave the Ice Fields Parkway. Our little cabin had it’s own fireplace, 2 nice reading chairs, a shower, and a small kitchen. You could easily stay here for an extended stay, but we just used the kitchen fridge to keep our beer and wine cold. Parking is just outside the door - making unloading easy. Along the very extended river bank, they have lots of Adirondack chairs for watching the glacial flow and occasional river rafters go by. Great way to relax after day hiking about. This place does not seem to be listed in the usual guide books, but it should be. Luckily our neighbors in Southern California found it last season and clued us in. We also ate at the wonderful onsite restaurant. Chef Kami Cochrane could easily make a go of it in San Diego. Food and atmosphere were great - even if you don’t stay at Becker’s I’d recommend you eat a meal here. One suggestion is to ask them directly about their various cabin configurations when booking. They had a lot of cabin variety, but I picked based only on what I saw on their website. While it was perfect for the two of us, I might have chosen something closer to the water given the choice. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g154917-d185654-r403726423-Becker_s_Chalets-Jasper_National_Park_Alberta.html\n",

      "172947 Some Good but a lot bad ---SEP--- I travel a lot so here is an unbiased review: We went to Indy for a night with our 3 year old, Saturday the 24th visiting the childrens museum, Colts game on Sunday the 25th of November. We arrived and were greeted by very friendly valet, check in was smooth, $30 to valet is a bit much. The hotel is in a bit of a war zone it seems, a lot of construction, chain linked fenced area across the street but a hop, skip and a jump from Lucas oil stadium. We stayed in the Louis Armstrong train car #004, the rooms are small, very narrow and long but we expected that. After the museum we went back to the room, went out for dinner and came back to swim. - The pool is freezing, not so much the water which I would say was around 78 degrees, but the pool itself is about 200 - 250 feet from the entrance and right in the middle of the first floor. So the air was cold, there is no separate room for the pool, the air is freezing but my son was excited to swim. - The rim of the pool is filthy, people were writing their names in the black oil on the tiles. - The pool towels were the size of a washcloth. COME ON GUYS, SPEND SOME MONEY ON REAL POOL TOWELS!!! On to the room itself - The room itself was a cool idea but it is old - The chairs had arms that were falling off and were old and dirty. - The bathroom was small, also, the fan did not work. If you are going to have a small bathroom, at least make sure there is a working exhaust fan - The linens were terrible quality, the towels were scratchy and India made garbage - The bed sheets were like sleeping on construction paper, anytime you move the sound would wake you up because the sheets were stiff and made with what appeared to be no natural fibers. - The only thing you really touch in a room is the linens, these were imported garbage. - The beds are SMALL, full size, my wife and I slept on one bed and it was incredibly small and we are not big people - This is a train station, the advertisement says you can hear the subtle rumble of actual trains as they pass through the station, IT LITERALLY SOUNDED LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE!!! I thought the building was collapsing, so did my wife. All and all, we will never stay at the Crowne Plaza again, the people were friendly but the accommodations were sub par at best and that is being nice https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d88164-r146182147-Crowne_Plaza_Indianapolis_Downtown_Union_Station-Indianapolis_Indiana.html\n",

      "690157 For the forest lovers only! ---SEP--- This place is situated on the lap of a hill, blanketed with trees and bushes. If you are a forest lover and take joy in seclusion, this might be the place for you. Each apartment is a separate wooden chalet and the path leading to them is pretty steep. It rained hard when we were there and combined with the steep path, our movement was quite restricted. The staff is pleasant and helpful. The porter service comes handy on the steep pathway. The cups in the kitchen cabinet were very dirty. The rooms otherwise were clean. The beach is 5 minutes walk away and there is nothing else near the hotel except a few houses. Overall- Good place for a recluse who loves dim lights and the jungle. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g656919-d258296-r148192964-Grand_Mercure_Puka_Park_Resort-Pauanui_Coromandel_Peninsula_Waikato_Region_North_.html\n",

The food is typical Hard Rock fare and with good size servings and tasty, the service was excellent even though the venue was packed. My little issue with this Hard Rock is that because of the layout it does not have the Hard Rock \"feel\" , it basically is a large curved room with a lot of tables and the memorabilia would have to be the least I have ever seen in a HR. Compared to the overseas venues the layout is poor however the experience of dining is fine. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d2239921-r194306767-Hard_Rock_Cafe-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html\n",

      "3259771 Food was lovely, felt rushed by waitresses ---SEP--- first impression was of surprise of how nice the setting was. We were shown to our balcony table overlooking casino.... Which was nice to be able to see everything going on. It was a very interesting place, lots to see and do. The menu wasn't particularly big, but something for everyone. I'd read how nice the steaks were, so I thought I'd go for that....expect to pay around £20 + for a steak.... This comes with nothing & each side was £3, sauce £1.50..... All these little add on's so your talking £30-40 per person dinner, not including the starters or puddings..... Was it worth it..... I'd say yes, it was succulent, cooked to a very high standard..... There was 4 of us, no one had a starter.... 4 mains.... 1 shared pudding as it was a chocolate tart & very rich..... Then drinks.... The bill came to £212.... Which included a 12% top at £24 which I think should be down to the diners discretion. We wouldn't have tipped that much, simply because the service was t the greatest, several times we had to chase our drinks up & we felt they were constantly checking to see if we were finished. I u detest and they're busy and that the tables are only available for a limited period of time, but we felt rushed tbh..... It's was 2 couples, with the guys drinking beer £4.90 each.... Me & girl had 4 cocktails..... Bit shocked to see they were £10 each.... I'm not tight and happy to pay where things are rightly due, I felt this was overpriced massively considering they were filled with ice. Did I enjoy the food and experience?? yes The food was lush.....would I go back for the food ....taking into consideration how nice it was, setting, drinks, price....... I would have to say no. I think it is slightly overpriced for what you get...... Not so much for the food, but I think the drinks adding another £80 onto our bill was a bit steep.... We didn't have an expensive bottle of wine, only a few cocktails & beers! https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d3486137-r238964311-Heliot_Steak_House-London_England.html\n",

Pool was nice and never crowded. Spa pool is great too. Our room was lovely, nice balcony and an unexpected sea view. Good toiletries too! Breakfast were a notch above the standard buffets with the omelette/eggs station and the wide variety. Great location (one block from the beach). 1mile to Ala Moana (walk there, get the $2 shuttle back when you've got all your shopping!) Lovely housekeeping staff too, friendly and efficient. No complaints at all, would definitely stay again and would recommend! One tip: if you go to the Saturday farmer's market you can get the public bus for $2.50 each or the hotel's limo for $15 ..

      "139027 Excellent stay ---SEP--- Hard hotel to fault, and a bargain when booked through one of the many on-line platforms. It's not clear when you book, but unless you are careful and select one of the \"feature rooms\" (which will cost you a lot more) if that's what you want or would be expecting, seeing the lovely Georgian building, you will be staying in the \"new, modern\" block to there side of the main building. (photo included) The welcome and check-in, friendly and efficient, the concierge passing on useful local knowledge as he leads you to your room. Our room, a very good size, very large bed, 2 armchairs (strangely rare in many double rooms), well equipped and nice little extras; fresh milk in a mini fridge, robes, safe, toiletries, etc. If you read my other reviews of a hotel of this class, you will see what I would expect to find available for breakfast; wide range of hot and cold, fresh fruit salad, all a big YES! All very tasty. My only slight grumbles: Christmas music at breakfast on the first morning (16th Jan) but sorted by day 2. Eggs and bacon a bit hard, too much is cooked at a time and left in the warmer - the only failure from my top notch hotel breakfast checklist. The shower has a musty smell, as if the drain was \"dry\" from lack of use. Excellent location, close the the main road in from the M4, and just a 12 minute drive into the centre of Bath. When visiting this time of the year, driving in and finding a parking space was easy. From past visits, this can be a nightmare during the \"main visitor season - use the park and ride - expect a long queue for the return bus at evening rush hour. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186370-d585297-r554633205-Bailbrook_House_Hotel-Bath_Somerset_England.html\n",

I have never been to this area and didn’t know what to expect. However, this hotel is perfectly located for easy access to the hospital (5 minutes down the road in a car) and straight off a main road. The hotel has free parking and we didn’t struggle to find a space each night! We did however stay Sunday-Tuesday so this may be something to take into consideration at busy periods through the year but I feel that there was a good amount of spaces for the hotel guests! Our room was better than what we expected for the money we paid for it, the bathroom was clean and spacious and the shower was probably the best feature - great lighting and a dual shower with a waterfall head! There are tea and coffee making facilities that come as standard and each day we were stocked up with a carton of orange, bottle of water and a kit kat! The hotel has a fantastic Italian restaurant connected to it which we ate in both nights as the food was delicious and again great value for money. Initially, I was expecting a cheap bog standard hotel for a short 2 night stay but when I next visit Newcastle wether business or pleasure I will definitely be staying here again.

Our large room was at the end of a long series of corridors and looked out at the trash bins. In other respects it was pretty nice. The breakfast buffet was good. The hotel is a long walk from the city, in a somewhat upscale area. We crossed the busy frontage road and enjoyed a walk through a residential area with parks. Don't think we'd stay here again but would look for a nice hotel closer to town. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186609-d212631-r212900076-The_Ardilaun_Hotel-Galway_County_Galway_Western_Ireland.html\n",
      "1370623 Awesome hotel ---SEP--- Just spent 3 nights over the busy Christmas week with 6 family members. Booked in advance and got a fantastic rate, for the location it was perfect. The hotel is centrally located within temple bar, perfect for walking everywhere around the city! Moira on the front desk was the most helpful and lovely member of staff I could of asked to deal with. Always went out of her way to help us in any way she could, even remembered my mum's name and her birthday, and left a birthday cake and note in her room! Excellent location, staff, breakfast was great and loads of choices, rooms nice clean and comfortable. Not loud at night, even though the rooms supply you with earplugs. Would stay again the next time I am in Dublin without hesitation. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214554-r336514019-Temple_Bar_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html\n",

Beautifully fitted out, in a welcoming town. plenty of local areas to visit, using the Commercial hotel as a base. We have stayed there 4 times with our spoodle and have always felt welcome. Dining can be had outside so a dog is no problem. The pet friendly room is luxurious as is the bathroom. Wish there were more hotels like this as there are many of us who like to travel well with our pets.

      "1924470 Seriously good steak! ---SEP--- I found Mugshot by finding what restaurants were near me on Tripadvisor when I arrived in Bristol (very hungry) and the positive reviews convinced me to give it a try. From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and shown to our table, all of the tables have a great atmosphere in cool little booths or downstairs with exposed brick and carpeted walls - very cool! Having not been before how the menu worked and how the food was going to be seved was well explained. Our drinks were delicious cocktails - presented perfectly. Simply put you choose your cut of steak, choosing your butter (black olive was amazing), choose your sauce and away you go. The food comes on a sizzling piece of volcanic rock and you cook it in your selected butter however you like it - simply delicious! Really good fun cooking the food, drinks were great, and service was excellent.

      "2417987 Not the thrills I was expecting ---SEP--- I was expecting a lot more from this huge downtown hotel. I've stayed at other Sheraton's and I felt like the other locations were top notch, this location I felt like I was at a tier below the standards they should keep. The amenities in the room were not up to my expectations of Sheraton standards. I selected a handicap accessible room as I have injured my shoulder not wanting to trip out of the shower. I expected this type of room to have all the luxuries as normal Sheraton but different heights. The gym at this large location I felt could have more equipment as during peak hours there was a line to use cardio equipment. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d1147292-r340234765-Sheraton_Phoenix_Downtown-Phoenix_Arizona.html\n"

      "1940952 A good find ---SEP--- I reached Armidale in the late afternoon on a chilly August day, and used Google+TripAdvisor to find somewhere to stay. My chosen location was full, and, driving away, I found the New England Motor Inn by accident: I was glad I did. It's a pretty standard motel, with all the things you'd expect - including adequate (though not great) heating, and wifi that worked fine for me. It was quiet and I got a good night's sleep; it was good and clean, and the front desk service was helpful and fine. The motel is next door to \"The Wicklow Hotel\" - which is a well-appointed pub with good food on offer. I managed to enjoy a few beers and a meal there - going back to my room in the interim! It's also well-placed for the other delights of downtown Armidale. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255315-d1645480-r140833667-New_England_Motor_Inn-Armidale_New_South_Wales.html\n",

We had to wait a few minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant wasn't full. Service after that was prompt and the wine suggested was very good. Friend and I had an entree each. Presentation was such a surprise maybe, that I took a photo and then dropped the phone into the dish! Was carpaccio with beetroot, so looked like phone had been kinda murdered...Oops. We then ordered a lamb and a chicken dish. The lamb was outstanding; tender and generous portion with various textures on the plate. Hadn't intended on dessert but just had to order after seeing 'pictures on a plate' at the next table. Deconstructed lemon meringue for me: the lemon curd was perfectly tart, the little swirls of meringue melt in the mouth. Friend had a chocolate dessert featuring a chocolate sphere. A small jug of warm Baileys gently poured over made it melt away to reveal an oval of ice cream. Really pretty impressive we thought for a chain hotel restaurant. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255112-d9826398-r500203134-Governors_Eatery_Bar-New_Plymouth_Taranaki_Region_North_Island.html\n",
      "40641 Over priced, dark and dingy. ---SEP--- We stayed at this place for one night whilst visiting the glorious mountains. On arrival a great deal of the parking lot was under water due to recent rain storms. We managed to find a space where we could exit the car without getting wet feet. The hotel has a main road one side and a railroad track at the rear - we were at the rear and the trains run all night. We had booked a deluxe room with 2 queen beds, the room was very dark, outdated and small, I'm not sure what the deluxe part was. It was also immediately next to reception; reception is open all night and we could hear all the conversations including someone wanting a full refund. The receptionist did not bother to lower his voice so as the trains rattled past we got to hear all the chatter at reception. An absolutely dreadful night. If you choose to stay here do not stay on the ground floor as not only did we hear reception but you can hear every footstep on the floor above and any conversation in the hallway outside.

I take the train to/fr the airport which is half the cost and is one block from the hotel. Harbor ferries are all a block. Starbucks used to be across the street but is gone now due to construction. The rooms are great. Beds comfy and pillows are not too hard and nice.My bathroom was on the small side but the walk in shower had plenty of room and good water pressure. I was on the 27th floor.

      "2073094 Good location, clean and comfortable ---SEP--- This hotel is in a great location and not too close to main streets so you don’t hear the noise at night coming up from the street. You do still hear traffic noises, but it is a city so that’s unavoidable. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Good facilities such as hairdryer, iron and iron board. Also have tea and coffee and a kettle. If you forget something like a toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, shampoo or something like that they will happily provide it for you free of charge, I was glad of this as I realised I’d forgotten a razor and wanted to wear a dress, so I asked at reception for this and they gave me a little box which had one and even a little mini shaving cream tube, which I thought was a nice touch. Only downfall was when a noisy family were in the room next to mine one night and in the morning their two daughters decided to play blaring music. Would be good if the rooms were a little more soundproof, but I guess there is not much they can do about that. Breakfast is good, choice of sausages, scrambled egg, beans and bacon for hot stuff. Have two toasters for toast with selection of nice brown or white bread. Also provide soft white baps. Tomato and brown sauce. They also have bananas, oranges and apples. Mini blueberry muffins, porridge, all butter croissants and various cereal to choose from. They have whole or semi skimmed milk, apple juice, orange juice, tea and various coffees or hot chocolate from a machine you just press which one you would like. They give you a card for your room key which also slots into a space at the door to enable you to use electricity and you need this to be able to use the lift or stairs so it’s got good security in the hotel.

      "1967586 Dive ANNEXE - closest thing to a home you can find in Sydney ---SEP--- We recently returned from an amazing 50 night stay in Sydney at Dive Annexe with 3 kids and our nanny and mother in law. It didn't come cheap to stay so long, and even being a very savvy traveler I felt my every single cent was worth the experience. Just a background - we lived in Sydney for 8 years in Eastern Suburb (Randwick) so we knew the area extremely well. This year, we wanted a extended \"holiday\" in Sydney in Northern Hemisphere Summer, the duration wasn't long enough to do a proper flat lease, but too long to cramp ourselves in hotel rooms. We considered many serviced apartments but Dive Annexe ticked all boxes. ** What you get ** In a short summary, Annexe is a standalone house approx 10min walk from main Dive Hotel, in an entirely residential area in a very quiet street. IF you are looking for Ritz Carlton with a 24hour Butler Service you are looking at wrong place. Instead it basically is like living in your own home, in a safe upscale suburb of Coogee. The photograph of the website is very accurate. You have 3 rooms. Room 1 with King bed and a TV, Room 2 with Double Bed, and Room 3 with a bunk bed. You get a very large backyard with nice BBQ facility. The house is literally like your own home, with clean bedding/ furniture nothing like a \"hotel\" rather more of a warm home. ** Why Dive Annexe ** 1) We wanted a home like experience - i got it. We were never disturbed by the hotel Management, our privacy was fully respected, with weekly cleaning done in a quick 2-3hours. 2) It is not like party serviced apartments - I hate \"Meriton\" type of mass-market serviced apartment, they tend to have many guest that hold party and experience has been miserable in past. At Dive Annexe, it's a perfect residential single home so it is only as noise as you make it. 3) Access to many parts of Sydney by bus - it's a 3min walk to nearest bus station with perfect access. You can get express M60 to Central Station or Darling Harbour. You can get frequent 373 service to Circular Quay and City. You can get 313/314 to Bondi Junction. Essentially you get a bus network right near your home 4) Parking onsite - it has dedicated parking bay in front of your house... anyone who's been to Sydney knows parking is expensive commodity - when I stayed at other serviced apartment I was charged AUD$30/day which is not even reserved parking and always full! 5) Parks Beach Parks! and Parks! - it is within walking distance to nature reserves and few large parks for kids to play in... we went to the beach park recommended by hotel management, every day! Kids couldn't love it more 6) Security - some parts of SYdney can be dodgy, more so in City at night or near Central Station. On the other hand, Coogee is an expensive safe suburb. If you don't believe me, check the property price... they are all $1mio+ apartments and homes around this home. ** People Factor ** Hotel management, in particular thanks to Mercedes, who looked after us like relatives visiting us. The hotel's staff are all friendly and reasonable... unlike other large operation where trainee graduates are manning the front desk. They all take pride in what they do, and very friendly... when I travel for business, I don't look for the \"friendly\" factor but when you take kids around you do want a hotel staff that really welcome your kids. So thank you! ** Little Touches ** Many places, when they advertise as \"cereals and breakfast item included\" you expect a no-frills bare minimum stocks of milk butter and cheapest bread you can find on supermarket shelf... This place isn't. I think hotel management has a taste and enjoy finer things in life - the breakfast cereals were from local Organic store, similarly bread they provided was proper rye bread... even milk, where I expected a generic no frills Woolworth brand, they provided \"proper\" milk... similarly they had Dyson fan/heater in the room, a Weber BBQ kit, a high-quality Australian Wool blankets in the room... I really appreciated the attitude of the management that they tried to make the whole experience a proper one, not a cheap-stake galore... ** Conclusion ** You will get your home. Period. If you want an exclusive hotel with 24 hour Room service, try elsewhere. However if you want a home away from home, take this option. When (and that's not \"if\") I return to Sydney with my full family, unless I move back there, I will stay at Dive Annexe again.... it was what made my Summer of 2014 so memorable.

      "2523471 Cool rooftop in the old port ---SEP--- Before to go ahead with my review, I have to admit that I was a bit reluctant to go to Perché as I am not such a fan of the rooftops in the Montreal old port area that I find too posh. I ended up coming here twice in a month. Once for a brunch and once for a Friday happy hour. Both experiences were awesome. The view is obviously one key element and the place itself is really nice. The food was really fresh and tasty (hello oyster bar!) and the drinks were great. Bloody Caesar for brunch and white sangrias during happy hour were on point! Finally, kudos to the ones that make everyone feel welcome and at ease, especially Jessica. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d12596556-r614235801-Perche-Montreal_Quebec.html\n",

We also particularly wanted to share a seafood platter for a starter (well worth it!) and fit in mains and were advised that we would just be able to squeeze it in. We were not disappointed and were on our way bang on time after an excellent meal. Every effort was made to get us out on time and the quality of the food really is excellent at Kayal.

The bar, leisure and cleaning staff are so helpful and always friendly. The General Manager was excellent, engaging and always smiling.

It was so noisy and didn't heat room atal. My partner and I slept fully clothed and had the spare double duvet too. For the price I paid I would rather sleep on the street - I was just as cold!! Told the woman at reception when checking out and she couldn't car less ... ' aww I'm sorry about that.

When it came to finally taking our order didn’t find the waitress welcoming or even apologetic for making us wait.

The staff were very friendly and extremely accommodating, providing me with an upgrade as I could not stay in an upstairs room. The room I stayed in was spotless. The facilities were excellent. As I was having breakfast on a Monday morning, my hot breakfast was cooked to order rather than buffet style. My only recommendation is that an upgrade be planned in the future for room furniture. The current style, although perfectly clean and acceptable, is a little dated. This is a great place to stay and close to the port and city centre. Thank you to the hotel staff, especially house keeping!. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255349-d255516-r241322743-Mercure_Port_of_Echuca-Echuca_Victoria.html\n",

The kitchenette was small. We cooked eggs and toast for breakfast easily, but I wouldn't want to be making a meal in the kitchen. There were plenty of towels and soap. The WiFi speed was excellent.

The front end staff were very helpful and accommodating and the lounge service was attentive. Battery Park is a great location in the City, as it feels safe and is easy to get to by subway. Even the 'non- view' rooms showcase the beauty of the New York skyline and the furnishings are sleek. We thought it strange that there was no lockbox safe in the rooms, but hopefully that is due to the rare, if any occurrences of theft. We enjoyed the complementary bicycles each day we were there and got to know the Greenway quite well; biking is brilliant way to check out the sights such as The Highline and other various boroughs. Only 4 stars because there were no recycling policies that I can remember. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d222959-r718408325-The_Wagner_at_the_Battery-New_York_City_New_York.html\n",
      "1120592 Hated this place!!! ---SEP--- To begin with, this property is entirely overpriced for what you get! But the worst part is the customer service - rather, the lack thereof. I do a lot of travel both for pleasure and for business, and have never ever stayed at a place with such terrible customer service along with snotty, unfriendly attitudes by staff! It was truly appalling! The thermostat in our room said 85 degrees when we arrived mid-afternoon, and it was well over a hundred degrees outside. We cranked down the air...when it was still reading 81 degrees by 9:00 that night we called the front desk. An hour later, no one had come so we called again....about 10;30 someone finally knocked at our door, looked around inside and out and then told us everything seemed to be working. By about 7:00 the next morning the temperature in the room was down to about 74 degrees, but by noon it was in the 80's again. We were there as part of a large family reunion and others in our parties had the same problem - it was very miserable! Evidently we were staying in time share properties so we they only came to clean and replace towels mid-week - which is when we were leaving. We had to call nearly every day for towels and wait hours for them to be delivered. One day they dropped off a whole plastic bag of sheets rather than towels so we had to call and wait hours more. The pool was just ok - way way too small for a resort of this size and the bathroom/locker room area was filthy!!! Only one time in half a dozen time we went swimming did they have towels - they were always out. One day after leaving the pool wet (because the towels were out, as usual) we stopped by the front desk....there I waited for 45 minutes for a couple of towels to be brought to me as they come from someplace across the property. Coupled with this was the front desk staff's snotty, unfriendly, uncaring attitudes - every single one of them! If I had employees like this, I'd fire them in a heartbeat! Coupled with poor customer service and employee attitudes, nearly every family unit in our group had trouble with their reservations....no record of reservations (this was our problem), no record of payments or deposits made (that's what most of the rest of them faced), etc. The issues took a ton of time to get worked out and figured out, it was extremely frustrating, and the employees didn't seem to care a bit that they had made errors and that we all spent hours trying to fix them! Regarding breakfast - each room got 2 breakfast tickets per day for a free breakfast, but what a fiasco! The breakfast was served in what appeared to be 2 old hotel rooms where they'd knocked the walls out....very tiny space with tables and chairs jammed in so that it was nearly impossible to get in the door or walk around once inside, lines of people waiting to be served, etc. The breakfast seems to be cooked by one woman and a few young men who seemed more interested in texting on their phones than doing the cooking....hence, half the food was out at any given time. If you wanted bacon, you usually had to wait 20-30 minutes for it, and same with pancakes, biscuit and fresh fruit. Their idea of \"juice\" was grape drink and Tang - truly gross! Then with everyone crammed in there, the room got stifling hot. With all the amazing places in and around Branson to stay, I don't know this place stays in business, especially with their terrible customer service. Beware making a reservation....chances are, your reservation won't be there when you arrive, as it happened to a half dozen of our family members. The resort had also promised to have us in nearby rooms, however when we arrived they said they never promise that and we were spread all over the place, making visiting very hard. I wouldn't stay here again if someone paid me to do so. Shame on the management!!! https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d549451-r115915475-Westgate_Branson_Woods_Resort-Branson_Missouri.html\n",

Our room was very solid - clean, big, and quiet - pretty much everything we needed. No frills but that's just fine with me given the reasonable cost of our room. The best part of the hotel was the people - the people behind the front desk and the people at the door helping with valet and with bags, etc. all could not have been nicer or more helpful. They always steered us in the right direction and provided great suggestions, and seemed really excited to share their favorite places with us.

We were able to check in a bit earlier than the designates time, the check-in staff was very accommodating, upon request they changed our room location for a quieter option. The room (executive junior) was very spacious, with huge bathroom and a small kitchenette area. There is a little fridge, sink and kettle and a coffee machine. I appreciated two packets of regular coffee instead on one that is typically provided. We used the room service for pre-ordered breakfast a couple of times, the services was timely and friendly. The food was great. We had dinner at the Evergreen restaurant, honestly might have been the best artic char I've ever had. There wasn't a ton of wine options by the glass but we were able to get a great bottle of wine for a reasonable price. The grotto pool area was a nice way to wind down after a day of skiing. The location is convenient as well, it's a far enough from downtown to be a bit quieter but close enough that you can walk to the restaurants and shops. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g154911-d183882-r158378249-Banff_Royal_Canadian-Banff_Banff_National_Park_Alberta.html\n",
      "565978 Great place for a convention ---SEP--- I attend the same convention every year and am glad they always hold it here. Lots of restaurants within walking distance, or the 2nd floor bar has good food if you don't want to go out. My room was made up every day well before noon. Everyone treated me like family. I left my iPad in the room and someone called me about returning it to me within a couple hours after I left. I look forward to coming back next year.I like that you can walk from the elevator to the convention center in just a few steps. And I appreciate that the TV offered a wide range of channels. They do need to add USB charging ports instead of just having electrical outlets but that is a minor complaint. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50226-d95253-r616537612-Hyatt_Regency_Columbus-Columbus_Ohio.html\n"

      "3066817 Well worth a visit! ---SEP--- I don’t often visit Maghull but I will definitely be coming back to this gorgeous pub. Me and my partner wandered across it on Sunday afternoon and thought we would pop in for a drink. My partner was impressed with the beer on tap - he opted for a Carling and I got a gin and tonic - plenty of gins to select from and was served how a gin should. We had no intention of eating but the smell of the food and seeing how delicious it looked we ordered some nachos with pulled pork and chicken wings. I could not fault a single thing, served piping hot and absolutely DELICIOUS! Would like to thank the staff and management for such an enjoyable afternoon. Worth a visit! https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186337-d2190231-r609319673-Hare_and_Hounds-Liverpool_Merseyside_England.html\n",
      "3061587 a bad birthday party ---SEP--- I gave a birthday luncheon for a relative who turned 80 years of age. The contacts with the restaurant staff in charge of group events was satisfactory long distance. When we arrived in Florida and met our group of 15 at the lobby restaurant, there was no one to greet us at the appointed time; I had to ask for the restaurant representative I had dealt with. She introduced me to the young waiter, whom I saw one or two more times after---all was handled, poorly, by the busing staff. The food was forgettable, at best, and served lukewarm: tepid salmon and beef are not fun! To top off a disappointing experience, the huge included tip (24%) was calculated with the rather high tax included, which should not be the case. Over $700.00 for a mediocre experience at best. It mystifies me that so many people seem happy with this place. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d3577696-r586249066-Toro_Toro-Miami_Florida.html\n",

The room lived up to expectation with a wonderful view of the Thames - worth booking just to see the lights at night and dawn breaking. Staff at the hotel were all very helpful. Breakfast was wonderful. We appreciated the courtesy car to Canary Wharf but actually the walk doesn't take that long.

      "1540134 Overall decent stay ---SEP--- I want to give 3.5 stars but i'll be generous and round up to 4. The hotel is more city high rise than beach resort. But short walk to the beach. The beach area is very crowded and commercialized. If you know that going in, it's fine - but if you're looking for Hawaiian paradise resort - it's more urban than that. Room was adequate - small but functional kitchen; we had a 2BR which worked well for our family of 5. Small porch that overlooked Diamond Head crater. I get annoyed at nickel and dime fees - parking fee, resort fee (what the hell is that?) , rollaway bed was 30 dollars/ night (we didn't use) - but I guess all of the hotels are doing it so I cant complain too hard. A different Aston had laundry in the condo (free); this one was in the hall (paid). Minor perk but one I enjoy when it's there. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d86993-r289600488-Aston_Waikiki_Sunset-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html\n",

The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that the TV did not have a sleep timer! The evening reception had light appetizers which were very good. We took their shuttle downtown and our driver was funny & so polite. The breakfast was AMAZING. The staff must love their jobs because they were the happiest people around. So polite, helpful, and just fun to chit chat with. I will certainly recommend this hotel to family & friends.

Very welcoming when we arrived, our room wasn't ready but they stored our luggage while we had lunch. The room was very nice with Ipad, free mini bar ( had beer, cider and soft drinks would have liked wine aswell - but that might be greedy), the bed was so comfy and we were on the 6th floor so nice and quiet. We had a lovely cake, fruit, a bottle of fizz and a card delivered to our room which was so unexpected and greatly appreciated. My only small complaint was when we arrived back late afternoon on our second day we hadn't had room service but Duane (who came to fix our Ipad) cleared our room and brought us fresh cups and handfuls of tea, coffee, sugar, milk and 4 bars of Green and Blacks chocolate - thanks Duane. We had after dinner cocktails in the lovely bar one night - they were delicious. We liked the hotel so much we recommended it to our daughter and fiancé who are staying at the hotel this weekend.

First of all, I would like to say Thank You to a female front desk staff (forgot her name, but she went to Bangladesh for vacation during our stay) Excellent service, super friendly and she also gave us a early check in. 2 thumbs up!! From Melbourne Airport: Take the Sky Bus from airport and only 1 stop to South Cross Station, and follow the instructions from the bus driver and will direct you to another Sky Bus Hotel Shuttle and will drop you directly in front of the hotel. Location: 5 min walk to the Queen Victoria Market. 5 min walk to Flagstaff train station. 5 min walk to the Tramp. (Tramp in the city are free to ride within the downtown area. If travelled outside the free tramp zone, you must purchase a Myki card at train stations or 711 convenience store. Hotel Rooms: Clean, big rooms and the best is that there is a kitchen. With pots, pans, utensils, dish soups, gas stove, microwave, toaster, kettle.

I was there to see 4 Phish concerts at Red Rocks, and I greatly appreciated the super soft and comfy beds each night. They were great. Having said all these wonderful things, I believe the BEST part of Hotel Teatro is the STAFF.

It badly needs a paint. The hotel is cladded in wood panneling and this really needs staining. It's a shame that such a wonderful hotel in the most amazing location has lost that wow first impression. Do not let this put you off. The staff are incredibly attentive and the room was spotless and spacious. If staying here, make sure your room has a balcony. Ours didn't this time and although spacious and comfortable, does not compare to the rooms with a lake view from your bed. Both breakfast and dinner were absolutely beautiful, all though curiously, they don't seem to know the difference between eggs Benedict and eggs Florentine.

There were 6 dark hairs in the bath, several on the bathroom floor and one long hair on the toilet cistern. I took photos. When we checked out we weren't asked if everything had been okay or if we'd enjoyed our stay, we were just told the price of the room and relieved of our credit card in a hasty manner. At $165 for one night I feel well and truly cheated. I am a hotel cleaner and if our team left a bathroom that hairy we would be hauled over the coals. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d647161-r215094335-Best_Western_Wellington-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Island.html\n",

We are a family of four (kids 15 &11). I'm not normally a fan of chain restaurants linked to theme parks, but this positive experience has changed my mind set. Our waiter was Randy (stop it, that was his name!). He was extremely helpful and ever so attentive. He knew the menu inside out, allowed us to bespoke our selections and impressively remembered our order. Soft drinks were replaced before you could get to you last slurp. The guy was not hovering around, but would appear like a genie when needed. Other restaurants should benchmark themselves on this service. Though relatively busy, the overall ambience was laid back and full of eye catching memorabilia. The menu may look a little on the expensive side for traditional American food, but it is fresh and the portions enormous. I would recommend skipping the starter and starting with the main course. Any normal mortal would struggle to eat both.

      "923609 Not perfect but better than expected ---SEP--- I found the hotel to be in pretty location in terms of access to the interstate and being reasonably close to downtown, Southpark mall area and other area of interest without having to pay for the higher prices of being in those locations. The outward appearance of the hotel and parking lot area seems to be dated but perhaps the hotel has done some recent remodeling or updating. The Clarion shares the building complex with another hotel so you can walk from one lobby to the other, I found that to be a tad odd. When I arrived at 3:30pm on a Friday there was no one at the Clarion front desk so I ended up walking into the other hotel's lobby before realizing I was in a different hotel. Eventually the front desk associate came out from a back room and then had to go up to check to see if my room was clean and ready which I also thought was odd. Once in the room I found the room to very clean and well maintained. The bathroom was very small, the door barely cleared the toilet but the rest of the room had very ample space and decent decor. The bedding was clean and the bed was comfortable with a variety of pillows to choose from. I also liked the carpet and it was clean. I only really had one issue and that was with the wifi. My original room was towards the end of the hall as I requested to be away from the elevator. It seems that the further down the hall you go the worse the wifi gets so when I inquired about the issues with the wifi the front desk clerk (different one from the one that checked me in) offered to move me to be closer to the lobby as that would improve my connection. I ended up moving and the new room was basically the same as my original but a much improved wifi connection and after that I had no issues with the wifi. Overall I found the staff to be rather nice and friendly. The rooms and lobby were maintained and clean. The beds were comfortable and there were no signs of dirt or bugs. When I come back to Charlotte I would have no problem with staying at the Clarion again. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49022-d4440324-r231432613-Clarion_Hotel_Airport_Conference_Center-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html\n",

When we were in the taxi from the airport the driver warned us of the location and at that point we doubted where we were staying. When we pulled up we were pleasantly surprised at the hotel. The reception area was clean, modern and the night staff that checked us in were very friendly. Room was perfect for what we needed, clean, two beds and all the amenities inc air con. One downfall on the first night was our hot water wouldn't work but second night was fine. The bar area was fab with fantastic staff. Only a very short walk to the city centre but we got taxis at night. I would definitely recommend. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212672-r172778112-North_Star_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html\n",

The place is noisy and you might get a few hours sleep if you are lucky. Complained the next day at front desk but not successful- just \"oh, I am sorry\" - I would not recommend this place to anyone due to the lack of supervision at night and yet condo itself was nice and clean. Expect lots of parties and late night music in apts. Swissbound!\" Travis Sedley who writes rebuttals for the lodge is wrong. There is no way of contacting anyone to report or intervene in these parties. It is 2:40 AM as I write this and a party on the main floor is in full swing with no hope of abating at the Mountaineer Lodge. Well Travis, what is the number to call? I checked the number in the guest information in the room and there is no answer only an answering machine. I heard that the resort has over 100 weddings a year. Once the gondola brings down the last group from Eagle Eye where the Weddings occur at 1230 AM, expect drunken after parties. There will be no one other than 911 to report disturbances to. You are on your own for security at this accommodation. It is otherwise a beautiful location and a wonderful newer facility.

Candace was quick to quick us some information on Little Current. As Candace advised us \"everything in Little Current is pretty much in walking distance.\" Our room was clean, neat and tidy. It had a coffee pot, AC, microwave, TV, hair dryer and small fridge. The AC was old and noisy, but it cranked out cold air! (no complaints with the AC). The room was not 5 star, but then again, we were not expecting 5 star...we were expecting a clean, safe place to rest for the night which is exactly what we received. Motel was full during our stay.

It is quirky and very old but so lovely! We stayed in the Town House (which is on the main street but not even half a block from the inn itself). The inn serves the food (which is delicious and very large portions). Our breakfast was included in the price and was plentiful and lovely (both a cold buffet and a freshly cooked hot plate of food from a menu). Our rooms were suites! Big room, big bathrooms (with a good shower over a bathtub and toiletries) and a kitchen should you wish to cook for yourself. There is no lift in the Town House so it's a bit of a trek upstairs (we were at the very top) but it's full of character whilst still being modern and clean. All this for £89 a night!

Location wise it's excellent less than 5 minute walk from the train station & the fact that it has a kitchen it allows you to cook your own food which is a plus. The facilities were also good. However there's some negatives. The grey haired man who may or may not be the manager is quite rude, i asked him to use the phone to ring a number from Sunderland to which he refused. Also the basement was closed off due to a broken fire door. This was an issue that was not made aware to me on arrival nor did the hostel even attempt to resolve the issue. Also the atmosphere in the hostel was poor mainly due to the fact you have people who live there full time and people who use it while working. Hostel should provide some walking tours and even a pub crawl imo https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186394-d609604-r566570815-Albatross_Hostel-Newcastle_upon_Tyne_Tyne_and_Wear_England.html\n",

      "1548359 Unexpected Disaster ---SEP--- My husband and I recently had dinner at Bistro Le Sam. We did not have reservations, so we could not complain when we were led to a two top in a corner of the restaurant that was in virtual darkness. My husband could barely read his menu and a small candle brought over by the hostess did not really help. The drinks were good, but took forever. We had the charcuterie plate, which was also good, but also took forever. And I do not mean a slight delay--we waited over an hour for the appetizer. We waited at least another 45 minutes to an hour for our dinners to arrive. My husband ordered scallops and they were inedible. I ordered a hamburger that arrived overcooked and completely dried out. The fries were average at best. And all of this at a price point you would expect at a restaurant housed in a Fairmont hotel. We watched tables who arrived after us receive their dinners half an hour before us. My husband, who rarely complains, reported our dissatisfaction to the waiter. The restaurant manager came over to hear our concerns and apologized for our experience. She asked if we would be willing to return for dinner (we were not) or tea. She made us a reservation for afternoon tea at an excellent table in the bistro. Frankly, having sat there for nearly three hours, we just wanted to leave. The next day, we realized that it was unclear whether the tea was on the house. Having no desire to give the restaurant another cent of our money, we declined to attend. In all fairness, the diners around us appeared to have much better experiences and the manager was very responsive and apologetic. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155033-d6988912-r224157527-Bistro_Le_Sam-Quebec_City_Quebec.html\n",

All the main courses we had , sea bass, salmon etc were all superb. The side orders (as mentioned in other reviews) were OK (and relatively expensive in an expensive restuarnt), I enjoyed the wine )again pricey) but there really needs to be a greater choice of less expensive wines, We had a table of 6 in a prime location and service was excellent (lots of staff), A famous reviewer has described is a place for oligarchs and I suspect it will succeed on this level.

I would definitely stay again. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186534-d288902-r428493176-Jurys_Inn_Glasgow-Glasgow_Scotland.html\n",
      "52559 Our Stay In Picton ---SEP--- We booked a last-minute train trip to Picton due to our west coast trip being cancelled due to the recent bad weather. From the first contact Nikki was friendly and welcoming and made me feel that i was making the right choice. We were treated like family members from the moment we arrived and Nikki and Brent were both fabulous to deal with and both very friendly and happy to chat. My little 5 year old Maddy made friends with Nikki very early on and Nikki even made time in her day to have a little tea-party with her and even Brent got roped in at one point. To me this made me realise how relaxed Maddy felt in this environment that she felt she had made a friend !! So much better than a sterile motel environment, We all felt so much at home. The Continental style breakfast in the morning was just marvellous. There was never any time when we felt out of place or uncomfortable and the property is beautiful. We would most certainly stay here again ! https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g285728-d1630652-r149388427-Sounds_Vista_Bed_Breakfast-Picton_Marlborough_Region_South_Island.html\n",
      "1720541 Nice restaurant ---SEP--- PLEASANT LUNCH A good restaurant in Notting hill. All the reviews on internet were positive about cocotte and we confirm the opinion of other customers. The service was quick and easy and I think it is very good for the lunch time. The staff was very nice and kind, our waiter Alessio, helped us choosing our dishes. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant, and I suggest you to book in advance. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d9994333-r750055759-Cocotte_Notting_Hill-London_England.html\n",

The room was lovely and you had eveyyou could want. The staff were really nice and the cooked a lovely fresh full English breakfast in the morning. If I need to stop in Norwich again, I’ll definitely be stopping here. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186342-d10470666-r679402240-Mangreen_Country_Hotel-Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html\n",
      "524048 Good quality hotel ---SEP--- Stayed here for two nights for a conference at the nearby Melbourne Convention Centre. Rooms clean- we had a view of the freeway and bay in the distance. I requested an ice bucket as the one in the room was too small for a bottle of champagne. This was brought to the room promptly and filled with ice. Hotel close to many restaurants in the area and a short walk to the casino. A little expensive for what you actually get- but it is a Hilton I guess! Did ask on check in about Wifi as I am a Hilton HHonors member but didn't have my card. The staff member said he would check and call me in the room but didn't. So didn't get free Wifi. Would recommend at the right price. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d1388984-r387983639-Pan_Pacific_Melbourne-Melbourne_Victoria.html\n",
      "373252 Nice food, long wait. ---SEP--- This is definitely a place I would recommend for the food, not quite if you are in a rush or don't like to wait. Even if the restaurant wasn't really full, we waited like 30 mins! The food is very good, rather excellent and not that expensive. You can also try some (I think) typical drinks with mango or coconut and things like that. Finally, I would definitely suggest to book your table during weekends, it's a very popular place! https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186334-d1214620-r629808738-Kayal-Leicester_Leicestershire_England.html\n",
      "6796 Expensive for what it is. ---SEP--- Reception pretty ordinary, Whole appearance very ordinary. Extremely expensive for what is on offer. We stayed in an ensuite cabin. Even with member discount it came to $119.70 for 1 night. Operated by Aspen Parks who are still working in the days of the mining boom. Certainly cannot recommend. Really miserable amount of very poor wifi too. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255320-d1164560-r256578480-Discovery_Parks_Dubbo-Dubbo_New_South_Wales.html\n",

There are some place to have a drink or have dinner near the house: there is a pub in front of the house and another one in 5-10 minutes on foot with good meals. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186370-d1448018-r269633842-Devonshire_House-Bath_Somerset_England.html\n"

      "3189360 Family stay ---SEP--- Our family had 3 rooms in your hotel for 4 days. The actual hotel was great, very clean, staff was kind & helpful, breakfast was well rounded. The only complaint we had was when we checked in 2 of the 3 room reeked of marijuana. It’s not the staffs fault but there is a no smoking policy in place for a reason. & you could smell it from the hall. We had to go out and buy air freshener & took till the second day for the smell to leave. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d6557701-r669284054-Sleep_Inn_Suites_And_Conference_Center_Downtown-Indianapolis_Indiana.html\n",
      "174933 Worst bday ever ---SEP--- We booked this place for 15 persons on a Friday night for my bday. When we arrived I was surprised to see that our \"table\" consisted of 4 tables separated from each other's. So warm and friendly ! And the place is so small that we couldn't stand up to go talk to each other's and were told by the (rude) staff to sit down. The coktails were good but at 15 euros each you better hope that they are. My birthday cake was thrown to me on the table and when I asked if I could get a candle he rolled his eyes and put the table candle on my plate. Tip : don't book a group of people if you don't have either the space or the will to give them a proper service. We felt like we were bothering them. I was really excited about this place and it ended up a big disappointment. https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d6849117-r394350845-The_Blind_Pig_Speakeasy-Dublin_County_Dublin.html\n",
      "781898 Handy for visiting Norwich ---SEP--- When we arrived we were greeted by a lovely male receptionist who was very knowledgeable of the hotel and went out of his way to point out the relevant facilities of the hotel. We were directed to our room which we expected to be a twin room which we had booked, however, we were given a double bed, which wouldn't have been a problem if the weather hadn't been so hot. The air conditioning was broken which didn't help. There was a space for a fridge in the room, but there was just an empty space where it should have been. The bathroom shower only worked when there wasn't embody else using the water and the shampoo, shower gels were not replaced, so we had to ask for some more on the second day. Breakfast was ok, but had to be quick before the bacon ran out. Dinner was without vegetables so we had to pay for them, but asked for a refund. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186342-d1645422-r170102021-Best_Western_Brook_Hotel_Norwich-Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html\n",

      "119308 Clean, close to stadium, and friendly hosts! ---SEP--- Chose the location for its proximity to the stadium, which was great, in the end it was just as easy a walk to the city centre too. The twin room was spacious and very clean. Modern facilities. Room layout meant it was very quiet from road/passing traffic noise, eventhough it there was the excitement of Rugby World Cup visitors everywhere! It was a nice surprise to be dropped off at the tourist information office in time for our bus to Stewart Island, which saved us a little walk and dragging our bags alongside! Thanks so much for a lovely stay. https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowUserReviews-g255120-d260449-r118436173-Birchwood_Manor_Motel-Invercargill_Southland_Region_South_Island.html\n",
      "2507139 Beautiful setting & very attentive and friendly staff ---SEP--- My friend & I visited on Friday 14th August to enjoy a birthday celebration lunch with a voucher my friend had bought as a Virgin Experience comprising a 3 course lunch & glass of champagne. We loved the very friendly and professional staff who delivered service of everything wonderfully. The starters were just the right size -we had ham hock & squid and both opted for the main dish of chicken although I have to say I was glad I ordered a side dish as it was a toch on the small size! Dessert again was good as was the wine and it was a lovely way to spend an afternoon in such a stunning setting -really good atmosphere as busy but not too buzzy as to be annoying. The staff are to be congratulated on their friendliness and attentiveness, we look forward to visiting again soon.

      "3009565 Managing a trip to Fenway and the challenge of Boston parking with ease! ---SEP--- The location of The Verb in relation to Fenway Park could not be more convenient...roughly 100 yds from Gate D. It is also a half a block away from The Old Time Trolley Stop #12. With valet parking on site, you can motor to Boston and leave your car at the Verb ($49 per night), see a Red Sox game, and do the Boston tourist thing on the trolley. You can also take your vehicle on a side trip and then drop it back off with the valet at no extra cost except for the tip for the valet.

      "1738085 Not completely convinced... ---SEP--- First impressions were mixed - the reception area is very clean and attractive but the lady at the front desk gave me a rather cool reception. I then went up to my (supposedly \"deluxe\") room to find that it overlooked the main road and a car park - lovely! I'd asked for a river view room and, whilst I appreciate that hotels can't always accomodate such requests, I really didn't get the impression that the hotel was full or even busy. The room itself was very nicely furnished and immaculately clean. The lighting arrangements seemed to be a bit complicated - I ended up just mashing the switches until a light came on somewhere. I was not happy with the level of traffic noise throughout the night (however, I should point out that I'm used to sleeping in a very quiet room). The bar area was very nice and a good place to relax, but the member of staff who served me didn't seem to be paying attention to what he was doing. The wine he served tasted as though it had been open a long time and stored in a warm place - not nice at all. When I checked out, I got a flavour of why this hotel has had such good reviews - the member of staff who checked me out and the doorman were so friendly and eager to help that I was left with more positive feelings for this hotel. If I stay in this area again I'll consider this hotel, but I'm not ready to recommend it yet. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d651411-r28668759-Radisson_Blu_Edwardian_New_Providence_Wharf_Hotel-London_England.html\n",
      "2932031 Excellent services, basic rooms ---SEP--- On advice from friends, we reserved a room in Canmore rather than Banff to avoid congestion and crowds. This was good advice! Falcon Crest is a 15-20 minute walk from downtown Canmore, with convenient underground parking. If you get up early, you can get one of the park passes from the front desk, which is a nice amenity. Customer service was consistently friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and it was great to have a kitchen for a week's stay. The decor is pretty basic but when visiting this area, you're out and about for most of the day anyway. Our room faced Bow Valley Trail, which gave us great views but also some road and train noise. If that's an issue, you might consider that when booking a room. We could also hear some (but very slight) TV noise and conversation from the room next door. Those are the only reasons for 4 stars, not 5. If we go back, we would book here again. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g181727-d551050-r387105920-Falcon_Crest_Lodge_by_CLIQUE-Canmore_Kananaskis_Country_Alberta.html\n",
      "1654956 Best place for business lunch in Moorgate ---SEP--- This is a very nice place for a business lunch. The chips are just amazing. I also enjoyed the scallops starter, the black cabbage and - of course - the steak was great, too. The knives could be more sharp, but I guess that might be a measure to make sure nobody gets hurt after the third pint or so. Service is great. It's lively but not too loud to have a conversation. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d3358142-r185864875-South_Place_Chop_House-London_England.html\n",
      "365679 Served its purpose, with much friendliness ---SEP--- For the price, it's a decent hotel, in a decent location, not too far from the Royal Mile or lovely Grassmarket Rd. It definitely had some opportunities. For instance, substantial stains throughout the hallways and built-up dirt in the corners of the bathroom. Seems to me they just need a thorough deep clean because it's really a nice hotel with a very friendly staff. It comfortably served its purpose. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186525-d622802-r93591424-Ten_Hill_Place_BW_Premier_Collection-Edinburgh_Scotland.html\n",
      "717378 As Good As Before!! ---SEP--- Myself and my partner had been here around about 4 years ago and it was excellent then so you are a little weary wether to go again as it might not be as before but no it was just as great as before.The food was well presented and every mouthful was a delight. I went for the fish tasting menu and my partner went for the christmas tasting menu which was very good of them to do as most restaurants will only have served the same tasting menu for each person.Great touch! Stand out dish in the fish menu was the king crab and the stand out dish in the christmas menu was the pork belly.(How do they get the skin so perfect) The great thing about the food here when you finish is that you do not feel bloated just content which is great. The wind a french Chardonnay was lovely. The service again we could not fault and nothing was to much trouble. The ambience had changed a bit from 4 years ago but it was still as good as before if not slightly better. All in all another great meal here ok not cheap but where is in London. I would love to go back again but may be not leaving it to long as i had before. Top chef Agnar Sverrison. Keep up the great work. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d878484-r332704320-Texture-London_England.html\n"
