From fresh strawberries and champaign upon arrival to all kinds of snacks and breakfast good available in the kitchen. I was in Columbus for a meeting on the Friday afternoon of our reservation. My meeting ended two hours early and the guest house allowed me to check in extremely early (@2:00) instead of finding somewhere to stay busy till 4:00 (Thanks a million!!). I love not having to check in at a desk...the electronic check in was very convenient and thee were three our four amazing/elegant restaurants within walking distance. **I was a little disappointed with the tax associated with this bed and breakfast. The room itself was listed as $275 but I ended up paying a 10% room tax as well as the normal 6.5% sales tax. While this might have been mentioned in the fine print, I was a little taken by surprise. While the room and all the extras was DEFINATELY worth the $321 we spent after taxes and extras, It would have been nice if the GVGH would point out this extra fee/tax. Overall; however, Great experience. I'll definitely be back.</td>\n",

Would have moved after the first night but there were no vacancies in Golden, so we were stuck. We were in a ground-floor room, which in a motel, means you expect a few bugs and crawlies to sneak into the room. However, there was a locked/closed kitchenette in our room that must have been infested with spiders. They continuously crawled out during the day/night -- we literally saw/killed dozens of spiders in a range of sizes all throughout the room, including in the bed, on the wall beside the bed, in the bathroom, etc. When we brought this to the attention of the front desk, the didn't have any bug spray and their only suggestion was to place wet towels under the crack to the kitchenette door -- which helped but was a rather lame solution when paying this much. In the morning, we re-iterated our experience at check-out -- and we were met with a surly \"oh yeah, I hate spiders too\". And that was it. Golden was an awesome, scenic place to visit.

The Days Inn sits on a promentory along the constant re-development of the Trans Canada Highway. This coupled with vibration of the trains in the canyon below keeps the spider community constantly active. If Mr. Burjack does his homework he will discover that spiders help in the control of insects including everybody's favorite the mosquito. Research will likewise indicate that the valley has an abundance of these creatures. Spiders are not attracted to human food sources but other insects to feed on. As a matter of fact we live on the opposite side of the valley and my wife hates them as well; I am constantly being called to remove them from the house.

The barman came into our room and tried to have sex with me and touch me up, then tried it with my friend..we phoned the police and reported him and he is now on unconditional bail being charged of sexual harrasement. I would never reccommend that a young group or couple should stay here. The only good thing was the pool and the breakfast was very stingy!!   \n",

       "220356               Whittier Suite II ---SEP--- My wife and I stayed at the Whittier Suite II for our first anniversary. The entire stay was amazing. From fresh strawberries and champaign upon arrival to all kinds of snacks and breakfast good available in the kitchen. I was in Columbus for a meeting on the Friday afternoon of our reservation. My meeting ended two hours early and the guest house allowed me to check in extremely early (@2:00) instead of finding somewhere to stay busy till 4:00 (Thanks a million!!). I love not having to check in at a desk...the electronic check in was very convenient and thee were three our four amazing/elegant restaurants within walking distance. **I was a little disappointed with the tax associated with this bed and breakfast. The room itself was listed as $275 but I ended up paying a 10% room tax as well as the normal 6.5% sales tax. While this might have been mentioned in the fine print, I was a little taken by surprise. While the room and all the extras was DEFINATELY worth the $321 we spent after taxes and extras, It would have been nice if the GVGH would point out this extra fee/tax. Overall; however, Great experience. I'll definitely be back.   \n",

       "204282  Worst $160/night I've ever spent ---SEP--- This is an $80/night place at best. And that only if they could control the bugs and generally clean up the rooms. Stayed two nights. Would have moved after the first night but there were no vacancies in Golden, so we were stuck. We were in a ground-floor room, which in a motel, means you expect a few bugs and crawlies to sneak into the room. However, there was a locked/closed kitchenette in our room that must have been infested with spiders. They continuously crawled out during the day/night -- we literally saw/killed dozens of spiders in a range of sizes all throughout the room, including in the bed, on the wall beside the bed, in the bathroom, etc. When we brought this to the attention of the front desk, the didn't have any bug spray and their only suggestion was to place wet towels under the crack to the kitchenette door -- which helped but was a rather lame solution when paying this much. In the morning, we re-iterated our experience at check-out -- and we were met with a surly \"oh yeah, I hate spiders too\". And that was it. Golden was an awesome, scenic place to visit. But next time I'll stay across the highway and spend $80.   \n",

We had the view of the city, rolling hills, and the ocean which was awesome! ( It doesn't get any better than that.) The food and service at the hotel's Lookout restaurant was also excellent. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful.   \n",

Just minutes away from the Naramata Bench, you will enjoy a home cooked breakfast (and not just any ordinary breakfast) and then you can be on your way to some fabulous wineries. When the hosts aren't serving breakfast, you will be welcomed into their home with kindness and wonderful hospitality. Don't be surprised to be invited to join Garry and Barb for a glass of wine and some great conversation while you enjoy the spectacular view from their deck. I highly recommend this delightful B&B to anyone visiting the Okanagan Valley!   \n",

Franklin County Ohio levies a 10% 'bed' tax on every hotel room sold, in addition to the State of Ohio sales tax of 6.75%. The 'bed tax' in Chicago is 16.75%, in Cleveland it is 15.25%, and Toledo and Cincinnati Ohio are both at 10.5% making the Columbus rate seem reasonable by comparison. The German Village Guest House is completely transparent to our Guests about this pass-through tax that all hotels must share.   \n",

       "204282  Sitting on the edge of the Canadian Rockies; Golden BC offers an abundance of nature. Part of this abundance are arachnids, deemed by the movie industry and fiction as awful creatures, spiders play a valuable role in the bio-diversity of the area. The Days Inn sits on a promentory along the constant re-development of the Trans Canada Highway. This coupled with vibration of the trains in the canyon below keeps the spider community constantly active. If Mr. Burjack does his homework he will discover that spiders help in the control of insects including everybody's favorite the mosquito. Research will likewise indicate that the valley has an abundance of these creatures. Spiders are not attracted to human food sources but other insects to feed on. As a matter of fact we live on the opposite side of the valley and my wife hates them as well; I am constantly being called to remove them from the house. The Days Inn -Golden like every Days Inn is involved he a pest control program as provided by PCO Pest Management.   \n",
