       "      <td>Perfect relaxing city getaway! ---SEP--- In need of some TLC I booked last minute. I called direct to the hotel the lovely receptionist was able to book me a room for that night on a dinner, b&amp;b spa package for 1 - this was advertised on their website for a couple but I thought I'd try my luck solo. Within 20 minutes the receptionist called me back to confirm that I could have my treatment when I arrived at 6pm or the next day at 2pm. I opted for immediate relaxation and asked for 6pm followed by a dinner table for 1 at 7.30pm. On arrival around 4pm the reception was picture perfect and I knew I was in for a treat. They took my bags up to my room and gave me a tour of the dinning area and instructions on how to get to the spa on the basement level. I was allocated room 3 The Manhattan room - AMAZING room more like. Colour scheme was egg shell blue green with a mellow brown - very bright and refreshing modern decor. The ensuite had a huge walkin shower with the biggest shower head I have ever seen the sink unit was also very unique and contemporary with a raised glass top and sunken metal sink. The usual mini bar and snacks were on offer and free tea and coffee making with fox's mints and a large complimentary bottle of sping water. A DVD list as long as my arm was availble for free use just ask at reception. After getting comfy in my room and feeling totally relaxed already I put on my hotel robe and wondered down to the spa in just my robe and socks. The wonderful aroma that met me in the spa was heavenly, the neck, back and shoulder massage was also divine, and the therapist was able to adjust this so I didn't need to lay on my tummy as I was just recovering from surgery. After feeling totally pampered and chilled out I had dinner in the restaurant - it was very quiet, but that suited me. A mix of young couples, a family group and some ladies were gathered in the bar area, some outside in the sun trap tuscan style dinning area. The menu looked very appetising, a lot of fresh fish dishes, a few meat dishes and a couple of vegetarian. I had the mixed seafood platter to start with which was lovely and the mustard lamb for mains. Big portions and amazing flavours. After a few drinks with some local friends it was off to the super cozy bed - I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the room was being a city centre location. It is away from the main roads and noisy nightlife part of the city! Breakfast the next morning was a continental style buffet with lots of fresh fruit, juices, teas, cereals etc plus the full cooked menu options - I made a special request for poached eggs on toast and a bit of bacon - it hit the spot! The hotel is right in the city centre, no need for a car to get anywhere. Norwich is a brilliant, vibrant city full of culture and friendly people. St Giles House Hotel is perfectly located to explore or if your feeling under the weather like myself just stay and chill in the hotel bar or lounge or ever so comfy fluffy beds. A huge thank you to all the staff that made my stay the perfect one night getaway relaxing pamper break that I needed. They were friendly welcoming and very helpful and accomodated to all individual my needs.</td>\n",

The room is big and has a small fridge and a beautiful bathroom. The hotel is antique and well maintained. Swimming pool, small gym and a very nice dining room are offered as well.

The apartment also had a complete laundry as well. The room was well appointed and quite comfortable and contained several heating/cooling units which made the temperature pleasant. There is a spacious balcony with dining table and chairs, which offered a relaxing view of the ocean and marina. The location of this property is very good as it is about a 5 minute walk to the shops, so it’s close to places such as eateries and supermarkets yet not right amongst all the shops where traffic and noise could be an issue. It is a 2 minute walk to the beach (a short walk over the main road to the foreshore).

The hotel is right near the downtown and allows for some great places to eat and visit that are close by. When I got back to the hotel I checked in and the staff to my luggage to my room, funny my colleagues didn't get the same treatment 3 weeks before, but oh well, I did. :) The bed is nice and the room is comfortable for its size. My view wasn't the best, overlooking the parking lot in back, but I only slept in the room so no big deal. The room was quiet and internet worked great. it is a great business hotel with a great buffet, but they are awful proud of their dinners so if you are looking to save some money search some restaurants close to the hotel.</td>\n",

       "0         Perfect relaxing city getaway! ---SEP--- In need of some TLC I booked last minute. I called direct to the hotel the lovely receptionist was able to book me a room for that night on a dinner, b&b spa package for 1 - this was advertised on their website for a couple but I thought I'd try my luck solo. Within 20 minutes the receptionist called me back to confirm that I could have my treatment when I arrived at 6pm or the next day at 2pm. I opted for immediate relaxation and asked for 6pm followed by a dinner table for 1 at 7.30pm. On arrival around 4pm the reception was picture perfect and I knew I was in for a treat. They took my bags up to my room and gave me a tour of the dinning area and instructions on how to get to the spa on the basement level. I was allocated room 3 The Manhattan room - AMAZING room more like. Colour scheme was egg shell blue green with a mellow brown - very bright and refreshing modern decor. The ensuite had a huge walkin shower with the biggest shower head I have ever seen the sink unit was also very unique and contemporary with a raised glass top and sunken metal sink. The usual mini bar and snacks were on offer and free tea and coffee making with fox's mints and a large complimentary bottle of sping water. A DVD list as long as my arm was availble for free use just ask at reception. After getting comfy in my room and feeling totally relaxed already I put on my hotel robe and wondered down to the spa in just my robe and socks. The wonderful aroma that met me in the spa was heavenly, the neck, back and shoulder massage was also divine, and the therapist was able to adjust this so I didn't need to lay on my tummy as I was just recovering from surgery. After feeling totally pampered and chilled out I had dinner in the restaurant - it was very quiet, but that suited me. A mix of young couples, a family group and some ladies were gathered in the bar area, some outside in the sun trap tuscan style dinning area. The menu looked very appetising, a lot of fresh fish dishes, a few meat dishes and a couple of vegetarian. I had the mixed seafood platter to start with which was lovely and the mustard lamb for mains. Big portions and amazing flavours. After a few drinks with some local friends it was off to the super cozy bed - I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the room was being a city centre location. It is away from the main roads and noisy nightlife part of the city! Breakfast the next morning was a continental style buffet with lots of fresh fruit, juices, teas, cereals etc plus the full cooked menu options - I made a special request for poached eggs on toast and a bit of bacon - it hit the spot! The hotel is right in the city centre, no need for a car to get anywhere. Norwich is a brilliant, vibrant city full of culture and friendly people. St Giles House Hotel is perfectly located to explore or if your feeling under the weather like myself just stay and chill in the hotel bar or lounge or ever so comfy fluffy beds.

No complaints apart from the £15 per night parking charge and the breakfast chaos. 2 attempts at scrambled egg on white toast failed abysmally as our waitress could not get to grips with a pen and paper. Would stay again but have breakfast somewhere else !   \n",

We had a lovely room with all the little extras that are expected in the best of hotels. Mudgee is very handy for the wine region and specifically we were wisiting the Logan winery, also very special!   \n",

It is a good hotel, staff are professional and courteous, rooms are clean and modern. The location is good with a Luas stop right outside, an added advantage. Breakfast was good with a good selection. We would have liked a muesli option but unfortunately this was not to be! We will return in August as this is our chosen hotel for the Dublin rock n roll half marathon.   \n",

We used one room with 2 double beds and one roller-bed. The hotel is located 5 min walk from the Circular Quay, the bridge and the Opera house.It is also a nice 20 min walk from all the shopping centers Sydney CBD has to offer. The room is big and has a small fridge and a beautiful bathroom. The hotel is antique and well maintained. Swimming pool, small gym and a very nice dining room are offered as well. Breakfast was good but we didn't try the bar.There is also flat-rate parking ($35/day). We loved it.   \n",

The apartment I stayed in was quite large and spotless. It contained a full kitchen with hotplates, oven, dishwasher, full size fridge-freezer and a large variety of cooking utensils, pans, glassware and crockery. The apartment also had a complete laundry as well. The room was well appointed and quite comfortable and contained several heating/cooling units which made the temperature pleasant. There is a spacious balcony with dining table and chairs, which offered a relaxing view of the ocean and marina. The location of this property is very good as it is about a 5 minute walk to the shops, so it’s close to places such as eateries and supermarkets yet not right amongst all the shops where traffic and noise could be an issue. It is a 2 minute walk to the beach (a short walk over the main road to the foreshore). The onsite managers, Michael and Emily were very friendly and helpful addressing any queries I had during my stay. I look forward to visiting this property again!   \n",

I arrived early and I was unable to get my room, but that was to be expected. The staff took my luggage though and I went out to explore the city. The hotel is right near the downtown and allows for some great places to eat and visit that are close by. When I got back to the hotel I checked in and the staff to my luggage to my room, funny my colleagues didn't get the same treatment 3 weeks before, but oh well, I did. :) The bed is nice and the room is comfortable for its size. My view wasn't the best, overlooking the parking lot in back, but I only slept in the room so no big deal. The room was quiet and internet worked great. it is a great business hotel with a great buffet, but they are awful proud of their dinners so if you are looking to save some money search some restaurants close to the hotel.   \n",
