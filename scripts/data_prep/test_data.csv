My husband and I stewed here for Christmas. And it was everything and more that I've ever dreamed of. Such a majestic hotel, with views that are picture perfect. Our Christmas dinner was gob smacking, the choices and quantity would please anyone. I'd highly recommend a stay at Fairmont Banff Springs, it is a dream come true for me and nothing will ever surpass our stay there. A true winter wonderland.	Dear Sunlily6336, There is nothing quite like Christmas in the Castle, it truly does become such a magical winter wonderland, we are so glad to learn that you were able to experience that! Thank you for your kind comments and for posting this review, it truly means a lot. We are also glad to know that this was a dream come true vacation for you, being able to be part of that memory for you is something we truly appreciate. We hope you will come back to the Castle again soon! -Fairmont Banff Springs	5	September 30, 2016	October 3, 2016
Clean rooms Basic facilities Friendly enough staff Catering was below average but we didn’t really mind as it’s not the sort of place and we just ate out Parking is a nightmare though - good luck finding anywhere on the adjacent streets Most of us used the manor car park - it’s free over night - and walked the 3 mins or so to lodge	Dear MJH1, Thank you for staying with Reef Island Lodge and thank you for taking the time to review. We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope you will come back and visit us again very soon. Thank you again for your valuable review. Kind regards, Reef Island Lodge	4	8 May 2018	N/A
This hotel is our go to hotel when we need to travel early from Sydney airport. It is fairly new, and we have stayed there twice (Feb 2017 and Feb 2018). The self-contained one bedroom suite is huge and well appointed, with an excellent bed and full bathroom. It is close to shops, restaurants, and the airport, and for us it has been a great way to start our holiday. We will definitely stay here again when we next have an early flight.	Dear John_P9764, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us and the TripAdvisor community. We love welcoming back our loyal guests and have a sense of pride knowing that Meriton Suites Mascot Central is your preferred choice of accommodation when you travel. Our oversized luxury suites offer more space and freedom for our guests to relax and unwind than a traditional hotel room. We do hope you were able to make full use of our resort style leisure facilities before your onward journey. John_P9764, thank you once again and we do look forward to welcoming you back to Meriton Suites in the near future. Kind regards Todd M Online Reputation Team	5	5 March 2018	N/A
Quick trip to Toowoomba to visit friends and family - Quest provided excellent accommodation and location to all the things we needed to do in 24 hours. Mini bar was the only thing missing otherwise 10/10!	Thank you for your positive review and wonderful 10/10 rating. Please let me know what you would like to have on offer in the mini bar as we are currently reviewing this option and may offer this in future. In the interim, we do have a vending machine stocked with snacks and (non alcoholic) drinks on level zero. We hope to see you again when you next visit the region. Kind regards, Cynthia Rice	4	29 March 2017	14 April 2017
Being regular visitors to Margaret River and decided to splash out on a romantic weekend for two. The property is lovely, the junior suite was large but for charging 5* prices its not quite 5* service. There were two, rather threadbare towels given per day (we had a room makeover included), the advertised free wifi in all rooms did not reach ou room in the new wing, the ipod player did not work. To make this place a luxury experience, a few small touches such bathrobes, new towels. The breakfast was average and overpriced, much better breakfast fare is available in town for half the price.	Dear GallowglasWA, Thank you for taking the time to post your review after your stay at Grand Mercure Basildene Manor. We are pleased to read that you enjoyed the property, however, disappointed to hear that you felt the service was lacking. Our Senior Property Manager has been made aware of the towels and media hub not working. Our General Manager has been made aware of your comments regarding breakfast, which is usually such a great success with all guests. Wi - Fi is currently only available in the public areas of the property. It would greatly assist us if you could advise where you saw free Wi-Fi in all rooms advertised. My e-mail address is sharon.norburn@accorvacationclub.com.au. Again, we thank you for your review and we hope that you will give us the opportunity to service you better by returning to The Manor in the future.	3	27 June 2012	N/A
	"It seems when things went wrong, I was not able to make them right. I pride myself in delivering exceptional service and I am sorry that, from your experience this was not the case. I do sincerely apologize for the ""The Tale of the Red Jacket"" and this will become a training process for our Team concerning communication and lost and found return. Our only saving grace was Kent, and we thank him very much for his service. We are happy that you made it home safely and that you have your favourite red jacket. Debra"	2	May 17, 2017	N/A
I have stayed here now three times for a total of about 12 room nights. The serviced apartments have been opened just a few months. The building, rooms, staff and particularly the large indoor swimming pool are just amazing. On my last visit the small cafe had just opened and it was also very good. The rooms are very large, seperate bedroom, open plan kitchen, dining and lounge area. All well appointed with good sized TV in lounge and bedroom. Views are spectacular. Washing machine, dryer, iron etc are a good touch for the longer stay. Can I afford the prices, maybe not, is it good value, maybe not, but it is certainly a good option to staying at a hotel.	Dear JA_travel_food, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us and the TripAdvisor community. We love hearing from TripAdvisor’s senior contributors and certainly appreciate the value of your feedback. It is a pleasure to be your choice of accommodation when you travel for business. Our luxury apartments certainly offer a home away from home atmosphere, perfect for your extended periods of stay. We are pleased you are able to experience our newly opened onsite café for your convenience. JA_travel_food, we thank you for you continued loyalty and we look forward to welcoming you back again where a warm welcome awaits.

Our stay was great! Clean room, comfy bed, friendly staff and good restaurants. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to others traveling through Thunder Bay.

we stayed at this hotel as we were going on a cruise ship so we just over knighted there. the location is great if you getting a cruise as it is very near the port. we had a snack at the pool bar outside which was very good with good service, there is also a shop to buy snacks which we did. our room overlooked a marina with lots of boats in very nice view. breakfast was very nice sitting and looking over the water. the bell hop staff were very helpful. we got a cab to the ship as the shuttle was not available.

We returned to Turtle Bay Resort this year to celebrate our 33rd anniversary after celebrating our 30th there also. We were pleasantly surprised on both visits with a bottle of champagne brought to our room shortly after we checked in. This is an amazing resort with the friendliest staff you could ask for from check in to housekeeping, restaurant staff to the guys and girls that hand out beach towels. Room were nicely decorated and the views were awesome. Restaurants range from poolside casual to upscale, all offering delicious food without a long wait. We will definitely be back. Great place to relax and unwind!	Happy Anniversary! Thank you for celebrating with us again. I am thrilled Turtle Bay is the perfect place for you to relax, unwind and celebrate your love. I appreciate you speaking so highly of our staff, as we all strive to make all of our guests feel the aloha spirit! We all look forward to welcoming you back and sincerely appreciate you recommending us to others. Mahalo, Danna Holck Vice President & General Manager	5	November 11, 2015	November 12, 2015
Rooms were spacious and well equipped for overnight self catering travellers. Beds were clean and comfortable, showers hot. The restaurant was very good and service was friendly except for the guy on the front desk who thought guests interfered with his day.	Dear Ali-Chris, good to hear how you enjoyed your visit but sorry to hear something was amiss with reception. Our apologies on that front and hopefully this was a misunderstanding and we have the chance to see you back again to see things in a better light.	4	11 April 2014	N/A
Its the place to stay if you have an early morining flight or late arrival and need to overnight. Beautifully appointed rooms, great restaurant and excellent friendly service from the moment you arrive! Used this hotel pre and post flights. Just great to get up and roll out after bfast across to check-in or vice versa on the way back.	Kia Ora Glennis, Really lovely to have had you back at Our Place! We're pleased to be your port of call on Auckland transits. What really delights me is reading that the service of the team always impresses from warm welcome to fond farewell. We'll look forward to your next return! Sincerely, Jonathan Tremain Guest Relations Manager Novotel Auckland Airport	5	24 August 2016	N/A
I'm unsure if it was the charm of the Hotel, the beauty of Donegal or the wonderful company I was in but our New Years Stay in the Abbey Hotel was second to none. The hotel itself is gorgeous, very rarely have I seen so many guests happy to sit and chat to each other in the hotel lobby and bar, a friendly atmosphere throughout, guests and staff alike. There wasn't anything that was too much trouble for the staff, all polite and friendly and The Lady who I'm assuming Is the head of Wait staff is a lovely character! My only complaint would be that the food was perhaps a little bland and dated. The room was clean, spacious and quiet with a very comfortable bed, I personally loved the huge wooden wardrobe and appreciate that there was so many hangers in it! The Gala Dinner and entertainment was a great night and ran very smoothly thanks to the staff who gave up their own New years to work, you were fabulous! I can't wait to return, you helped make my first trip to Ireland very special, This Hotel truly is the heart and soul of Donegal.	Dear hotelworkerfoodlover, Thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay with us at The Abbey Hotel during the New Year Celebrations. We appreciate all of your kind compliments and are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay. We take huge pride in offering our guests the best in Irish hospitality and it means a lot to all of the team here that you believe the hotel is the heart and soul of Donegal Town. We couldn't agree with you more! We look forward to welcoming you back again in the future. Kind regards, Niamh	5	3 February 2017	N/A
Stayed here for one night on business. Staff were very helpful on check in and the complementary glass of wine was very welcome. The room was nice and clean although not very well sound proofed. It was also strange to have a single bed although it was very comfy. Breakfast had a good range of choice and was cooked to order. The staff seemed very friendly and helpful. For the price paid I could not complain and will return next time I'm in leeds. The location is good for the city centre.	I am delighted you had an enjoyable stay with us and that you intend to return to us once again when on business in Leeds. We only have a few single rooms and we do offer these at competitive rates and I am pleased that this was good value and that you found both the staff and cuisine to be of a high standard and our location ideal. We look forward to welcoming you again soon on your next business trip to Leeds.	4	2 March 2014	N/A
What can I say, perfect, clean, immaculate, wonderful & friendly staff right from the boys who take you to your camp spot to the staff in the reception. We stayed their with our campervan and had an ensuite site. Brilliant. Credit to everyone involved.	It is fantastic to receive your “brilliant” review. Thank you very much. Our staff all work hard to maintain our beautiful resort to a high standard and we will pass on your compliments. See you next time!	5	18 July 2015	N/A
Thank you Simon for taking us on a walking tour of Terragong, the home where my grandma grew up in the 1880s. It gave me an insight into how my grandmother's generation lived. I saw the tree still standing next to the main house that she used to climb, along with her initials etched in a bedroom window pane using her sister's diamond engagement ring. Visiting her family home gave me a sense of a carefree and adventurous country girl. The attention to detail during the restoration has been extraordinary. It is a time capsule of 150 years of a Georgian country residence combined with a modern twist . Two things stood out for me, Simon and Daryl's professional creative restoration, combined with a deep respect for the families who lived there for seven generations. We look forward to visiting as B&B guests one day soon and sharing in more of your wonderful stories.	Dear Julie - Thank you so much for your review of your visit - and I also must thank you for sharing memories of your grandmother with me; it all adds to the richness of the history of Terragong. Darryl and I look forward to having you back for a stay in the very near future! Warmest regards, Simon	5	30 September 2016	N/A
Friendly hotel with attentive staff who work hard to ensure you have a good stay. Ignore the rather imposing and stark view of the hotel from the car park, inside is luxurious as is the front of the hotel - grand. Good restaurants serving good food all be it a little expensive, service is top notch. Free round of golf for guests on a good standard of course, unfortunately the only way they can offer this is to have very close together tee off times which makes for a congested and unpleasant experience, I walked off after 9 holes. We've stayed twice and very much enjoyed it , this hotel is one of our twenty year old daughters favourite in Cornwall.	Thank you for your good 4* review of the Carlyon Bay Hotel! It is fantastic you enjoyed your recent stay and found the staff to be both attentive and hard working. I am delighted you enjoyed the food served throughout your stay as well as the service received. It is brilliant you made use of our championship golf course during your stay. Our tee off times are all set with the standard gap of 7 minutes between tees. Please accept my apologies if you felt this was not enough time for yourself. I am particularly pleased we are one of your daughter's favourite hotels in Cornwall! I hope we can welcome you back in the near future. Kind Regards CBH	4	25 August 2019	N/A
Enjoyed the Sydney Harbour views , daily unit serving , pleasant professional and courteous staff. Proximity to CBD via Taxi , Uber or ferry was convenient. Blues Point Road restaurant precinct was appreciated as was the Oaks at Neutral Bay for an unforgettable steak and Clos Otto Shiraz.

We are delighted to read you enjoyed our five star standards in customer service and quality accommodation at Meriton Suites North Sydney and we do hope you were able to take some time to relax and unwind in our resort style leisure facilities throughout your stay.

A fairly typical example of this Hilton brand, with an unusual for Hampton evening bar. Location is very convenient to business and government centers, to nightlife and cultural activities, and it's a short walk to the Brightline rail terminal. Staff is friendly and helpful with area suggestions.	Hi Beerwriter, Thank you for sharing your opinion and your valuable feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We certainly appreciate your comments and we hope you will choose us again when you visit Ft. Lauderdale	4	January 19, 2019	N/A
In a word the location of the hotel is supper! And there is a free parking. Except location everything is average quality including breakfast (same breakfast is served every morning). One of the most negative thing is the sleeping quality due to the neighborhood (e.g. nightclub). Better to avoid rooms on the main street side (e.g. East Colfax Avenue).	Hello there, Thank you for taking time to write a review on us. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our great location and free parking in Denver Downtown. However I am sorry that we didn't meet your expectations in breakfast and neighborhood. We can try to add some more items for breakfast. Thank you, Days Inn Denver Downtown	3	March 15, 2019	N/A
This is a relatively new hotel (only about 8 months old). Everything is brand new, fresh, clean and stunning. It was just another chain hotel. It had this great unique feel to it. We had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building from our room. On the top floor is also a bar/restaurant with a great view of the city.	Dear Maranda R, We are pleased that you had such a great stay and found Archer to have a cool, unique vibe. The view of the Empire State Building is spectacular and so glad you were able to enjoy from your room. Thank you for choosing Archer Hotel and we hope to see you again.

A new Holiday Inn. Very good and should be as only just opened. Only problem is Parking. None at Hotel. 2 open air parks opposite the hotel But???? A multi storey @ £6 night nearby but with any heavy cases or bags???? Too far. Staff excitable	Dear DKKeeling, We very much appreciate you taking the time to post a review regarding your recent stay with us. I’m pleased to hear overall you had an enjoyable visit. We do not have onsite car-parking, however we do have as you stated a guest discount in conjunction with the Great Northern Mall directly facing the Hotel. We currently offer a 50% discount for city centre parking, which is highly competitive. We very much look forward to getting the opportunity to serve you again soon.

have stayed here before but was suprised at $20 service charge on top of prepaid booking. Very convenient as access direct into mall ample parking in mall car park rooms are fine but ours was a little tired .Handy little convenience shop near reception	Dear royshep5, Thank you for taking the time to post a review following your recent stay at our hotel. I am pleased you found our location convenient with direct access into the Florida Mall, and that our sundry shop just past reception was handy for any last minute needs. I did however also note your disappointment with the service fee, and I am truly sorry for any inconvenience you may have experienced as a result. The daily service fee is widely disclosed via our website, and other booking avenues through various industry partners. Our decision on the service fee is made solely for the convenience of our guests, and is generally very well received. It covers the cost for private self-parking for hotel guests, unlimited internet access in your guest room and all public areas, state of the art 24hr business center, expanded fitness center, in room safe and refrigerator along with two bottles of water daily. We fully realize that not all of our guests will use all of the amenities all of the time, but in these economic times it is simply the cost of consistently providing and maintaining exceptional service and amenities, with exceptional people. Thanks again for your business, and for taking the time to write a review. We appreciate your business, and look forward to welcoming you again the next time your travels bring you to the Orlando area. Sincerely, John Lamont General Manager	4	March 9, 2018	N/A
I always try to stay at this hotel on business when i'm working in Canary Wharf. Great location and in walking distance. Rooms are always very well presented and good size. I also find the rooms very quiet and never get disturbed. The service and facilities at this hotel are also very good, and the buffet breakfasts are fantastic. I always get treated very well and feel welcomed.	Dear Guest, Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stays with us. I am delighted to read you enjoy returning to the hotel on a regular basis and hopefully our high standard will continue through your future stays. If there is any help I can provide or any special requests you may have, please feel free to contact me directly as I would be delighted to help. I look forward to hearing from you.

Lots of cool features in the rooms; I have a preference for the optional flat foam pillow. Nice, modern bathroom design, with big hand pump bottles for shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Toilet bidet was a nice luxury! Top quality food in the restaurant(s).	Thank you for your review. I am pleased you enjoy the amenities that we offer especially the pillow menu and bidet. We look forward to having you back again soon for a visit.	5	July 18, 2019	July 23, 2019
Very enjoyable stay, staff pleasant and chatty. The Hotel is in a great location in town and the rooms are nice, slightly small but this was reflected by the price of the room which was excellent!!!!!	Great price, great place, great review!!!

The facility was OK, and staff was very helpful. The food at Squaw Peak was good, but the service from George, was actually the highlight of our stay. Attention to personal service.

I would have to say one of the best I have ever stayed , with the staff are fantastic very helpful and very nice .The rooms are very very clean and lovely .Not far from Brisbane you don,t have to drive into Brisbane and pay for parking your car ,you can sit back in a train or a bus and still have all your hair	Dear Anne C – we are glad that you saw our Motel sign and called in. Thank you so much for your positive review and we agree that it is so convenient to travel by train or bus into Brisbane CBD rather than trying to drive in the traffic and find a park. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to Brisbane. Kind regards Sue & Paul Petersen Managers	5	18 August 2015	N/A
5 Star for a 3 Star Hotel. No view of ocean or mountains but just a clean comfortable place to stay. It is a smaller hotel and tucked in behind Smitty's Restaurant. Had a King Size suite. Huge room. Very comfortable bed. Bathroom had a jet tub plus a separate shower stall. Quiet. We would stay here again and recommend it to others. Close to ferries, airport, and about 15 - 20 minute drive to Butterfly Gardens and Butchart Gardens. Great for a quiet mini holiday.	We appreciate the kind (and detailed) review and are happy you thoroughly enjoyed your stay! If ever you want to come stay with us again and would like the same room please contact the hotel directly, our Front Desk Agents will be more than happy to assist. Happy Holidays!	5	December 24, 2016	December 25, 2016
Hotel is nice, nothing special for the price. Location and bar are nice, bar staff seems somewhat put off by having to talk to guests. We were not going to have breakfast at hotel but not a lot of great options nearby. Glad we did, we received 15% off with the room and the breakfast buffet was very well done, with some great coffee too. The hostess was very nice.	Thank you very much for your review of your recent stay with us here at Limerick Strand Hotel. We pride ourselves on exceeding guests’ expectations and delivering enjoyable and memorable experience.

My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Endeavour Motel overnight as it was close to our venue and not far from the centre of town. We were pleasantly surprised with the size of our room. It was very clean, quiet and the bed very comfy. We would happily stay here again.	Thank you for your lovely comments, I am very pleased the room was to your liking.

"Le Meridien Charlotte helped my fiancé execute the most beautiful surprise proposal for me! Aisha and her top of the line concierge staff went above and beyond to ensure that the proposal was carried out with flawless professionalism and a level of service that exceeds no other. From assisting in making sure that the suite was perfectly decorated for the proposal and complete with celebratory champagne/wine and chocolate/strawberries, to providing a personal concierge escort to the City Lights Rooftop where a private romantic dinner for two awaited and illuminated with ""Marry Me"" candles---it was all perfect! The GM also assisted in putting together a playlist of love songs that played in the background while we enjoyed our dinner and champagne on the rooftop. Aisha and her concierge team were always so attentive and ready to fulfill any request (but were so proactive in knowing exactly what to do that no requests were needed). She offered to take pictures and even suggested we have our first dance on the rooftop as an engaged couple. We loved her and couldn't have asked for a better concierge team! Thank you, Le Meridien Charlotte, for forever being part of our family!"	Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us! Congratulations on your recent engagement! I will let Aisha and our concierge team know how much they elevated your experience at the Le Meridien Charlotte. -S	5	February 2, 2017	N/A
Awesome experience, great room , my kid loved the bunk bed. In hotel activities were great too like LEGO contests, treasure hunt ,pirate ship dance party or just LEGO play. Complementary juice and water in room along with in room bricks for play. Loved the disco elevator , my son danced every time. Checkout our experience video on YouTube or insta @ viaan_fun	Hello Viaan_fun, Thank you for booking a stay at the LEGOLAND California Hotel and for your 5-Star review! We are happy to hear that your family enjoyed their stay, as well as some of the extra amenities we offer, such as the activities for kids to enjoy when they aren't playing inside the LEGOLAND Park. The disco elevator is one of my favorite parts of the LEGOLAND California Hotel, and I am happy to hear that your son enjoyed his daily dance parties on the elevator. We hope to have you stay again soon! Best Wishes, Jessica Guest Experience Team	5	March 1, 2020	March 3, 2020
Room and staff were grand. Food was a total let down. Rang room service at around 11pm to see if there was anything available to order. They replied with pizzas so we ordered one. To our dismay, a pizza which was obviously from frozen and just popped into the oven arrived up. It wasn't even cut for us. We didn't even eat it as it wasn't appetising at all. We thought nothing of it until the next day. We ordered cheese burgers at the bar and what came out was meat which was obviously from frozen once more. The meat was also burned and we couldn't even eat the burgers since they are so appalling. Dessert selection is also extremely poor, so we made a quick getaway after paying. For such a prime location and fancy hotel, a lot more was expected. We left extremely disappointed and underwhelmed. We will not be recommending the Gresham to others, will not be staying here again and we definitely will not keep quiet about this.	Dear guest, Thank you for choosing RIU Hotels & Resorts and taking time to give us your feedback We are glad that you received a positive impression of the location of our hotel, because at RIU, we carefully select the locations where our hotels are built and as a service-oriented hotel chain, we really appreciate your kind words about our staff. Furthermore, we are glad that your guestroom was to your satisfaction. On the other hand we regret to read that we were not able to meet your taste in our restaurants with the dishes served at our restaurant. We can assure you that we strive to improve our service daily in order to offer all our guests in house and future clients a pleasant stay.

We simply loved the Bryant Park Hotel. It was the perfect location for our 4 night getaway. Walking distance from so much of what we wanted to see (Broadway shows, Times Square, NY Public Library, Central Park, etc), and very convenient to jump on the subway for the rest of Manhattan. We also loved just crossing the street and hanging out in Bryant Park. Very friendly and helpful staff, and our suite was impeccable - spacious, great views of the park and library, very comfortable bed, very quiet and private, simply perfect. I can't imagine we will ever stay anywhere else in NYC.	Hi evanscm, thank you so much for all the amazing praises. I am so happy to hear you had such a memorable stay and that you were able to enjoy all the neighborhood has to offer. I love the fact that we are so close to Times Square but not right in the middle of all the excitement. We can't wait to welcome you back again. If I can ever be of assistance please let me know. All my best for a wonderful and successful 2018. Darren; dsumner@bryantparkhotel.com	5	December 24, 2017	N/A
This is a great motel in an excellent location. The room was plenty big,clean and very comfortable. The staff was fantastic! They even offered a free glow worm tour in the evening(it is just a short walk from the motel). Easy walking distance to all the restaurants/bars/grocery in the village.

Bathroom & carpet definitely made the ratings low for me. Bathroom is mouldy & needs a proper scrubb and replacing. Air vents need cleaning, carpet needs professional clean, windows need wipe, bathroom tiles need upgrade. Disappointed with what i paid for this room would of easily paid bit extra to stay somewhere more fancy. Pictures showed false advertising of hotel location we actually thought it was on the riverfront of harbour. Anyway, wont stay again staff friendly. No pics	Dear Nora Thank you for taking the time to provide us with feedback. I do apologise as there was a clear miscommunication. Our Queen Executive Harbour rooms show are equipped with Queen beds and have views of Darling Harbour and cockle bay. I do apologise if their was a misunderstanding on this. However I do agree with your comments regarding cleanliness and have shared your comments with our Executive Housekeeper. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of.

We stayed here from 11.8.13 to 13.8.13 and we were surprised with what we got. We had booked the stay via Groupon and we got the deal with kids go free. But there were complications as the hotel then said the kids do not go free. Once that was sorted we left to go to the hotel. Parking was limited due to the learner driver cars parked on the hotel carpark. The fried breakfast was far too over cooked and we had to wait for tea and toast to come, had the fried breakfast done before it arrived even though it was asked for before the fried breakfast was ordered. Bar food was disgraceful, the burgers we had were undercooked, so undercooked they were raw in the middle. the drink (bacardi breezers) in the bar that were ordered were out of date by 5 months!! Was so shocked at this and was very unhappy. Staff were friendly and helpful. The facilities were excellent, we had 2 kids with us and the pool made them very happy. Overall the experience was nothing like a 4* hotel.	Hi, Thank you for posting a review following your recent visit to us. I was naturally very concerned to read the issues that you raised. I would very much welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters with you directly and with this in mind I would be delighted if you would contact me personally on joeobrien@cavancrystalhotel.com Thank you again for your feedback and I look forward to hearing from you. Kind regards, Joe O'Brien.	3	13 August 2013	17 August 2013
clean and comfortable. needed an extra towel which was brought quickly. For a Saturday night few choices of eating nearby. Appreciated that they had DVDs available at the counter for use. took a while to figure out the stove but otherwise ..........	Thank you for your review, davelV7665CY - I am glad your stay was clean and comfortable. Quest Ballarat is located within easy walking distance to many local cafes and restaurants. Please feel free to ask our friendly staff for directions or recommendations should you stay with us again in the future. Kind Regards Katherine - Front Office Team Leader	4	28 June 2017	29 June 2017
This is a well located, fine hotel, with very friendly, staff, comfortable rooms, good breakfast and normally I would be giving a five star review, but not in this case. On the first night, the hotel fire alarm went off and we were all urged to leave by the stairs. On reaching ground level, the fire door could not be opened from within. As more people piled down the stairs, a sense of panic started and people began to shout, scream and bang on the door. Luckily, after a period a member of staff arrived and opened the door from the outside. How someone signed off on this fire safety I cannot imagine. Apart from this the hotel was excellent, but the starting point should be providing basic fire safety, and for a new hotel it is incredible to see such a fundamental flaw.	Dear corkboy2009 Thank you for taking the time to write a review. It’s great to hear you found the staff to be friendly, and enjoyed the location of the hotel. Regarding your feedback about the fire evacuation, I take this extremely seriously. I will be sharing this with all my team as a matter of priority to ensure all staff are fully aware of fire evacuation procedures and my maintenance team will conduct a full and thorough fire safety review of all exits and doors. The safety of our guests is paramount. I will certainly ensure this does not happen again and thank you for bringing this to my attention. Warm Regards Michael Poux General Manager	4	22 January 2017	N/A
Superbly decorated dual aspect room with great facilities and a very comfortable bed. Clive was an absolute joy to chat to and was very helpful in providing us with information for getting around the beautiful city of Norwich. His cat, Khmer is a little poppet, too!	Thank you so much for having taken the time to write your review. I'm glowing with pleasure at being described as an absolute joy to talk to. It was in fact a joy (that word again) to have you both here and I was only sorry that it was such a brief stay. I look forward to welcoming you some time in the (near) future.	5	29 May 2017	31 May 2017
Stayed here for a couple of days while my wife was in the hospital. Clean and roomy at a reasonable price. Every room was a suite and every suite was water view. Would return if we come back to Tampa.	Thank you for your review. We appreciate your comments and we are glad that you enjoyed your stay. We would love to welcome you again, should your travels bring you back to the Tampa area!	4	October 13, 2016	N/A
We have a lot of family in the area and stay here whenever we can. The place is convenient, clean, and staff is good. Namely, Taran, from the breakfast staff is exceptionally helpful and always remembers us with a smile. Thank you Best Western & Taran for the help!	Thank you for your lovely comments regarding Taran. She is a fantastic member of our team. I will be sure to show her your review. We look forward to seeing you again on your next visit!

The price is to high for the quality. We were given the wrong room type and after an hour (11:30PM), the toilet ran all night, the coffee pot did not work. The hot tub had mold in it. This hotel is due for a renovation.	Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns with us. We appreciate your feedback. I met with our management team and went over the issues you encountered and made sure they were resolved. I am very sorry for the inconveniences you encountered, and I do hope you will stay with us again and give us another opportunity to earn your loyalty.	2	September 15, 2014	September 16, 2014
Our stay here was truly amazing, it was so peaceful, clean and very tranquil. The owners are so lovely and made us feel so welcome. Nothing was too much trouble. The studio is very modern, spotlessly clean and so welcoming and homey.Bed was so comfortable and beautiful to sleep in. Don't stay with 100 other people In a hotel, of you go to Tamworth stay in this beautiful setting with wonderful welcoming and friendly hosts. keen to stay there again next time. 5 star rate from me. Thankyou	What a review, thankyou! It was lovely to have you both stay with us and we very much appreciate your great feedback. Many thanks, Michaela and Craig.	5	28 July 2016	N/A
"Just spent 3 nights at this hotel. Overall the location is great for conventions, sport, concerts and movies. Short distance from Ybor (older funky section) as well as U of Tampa. Within walking distance to Channelside restaurants as well. Glad the hotel is renovating, rooms need painting and updating but never was effected by work done. Staff was wonderful. Last day we were trying to get a few minutes of sunshine poolside. Had just ordered drinks when a fierce thunderstorm had us running for cover. Waitress ""Magda"" helped us bring drinks up to hotel room. Fifteen minutes later she appeared at our door with free popcorn, coca cola and a pass to watch any movie we wanted free of charge due to the bad weather ruining our pool fun! The hotel also allowed us a later check out to have time for the movie! Overall an unexpected nice touch well appreciated. Another nicety was being able to use the hotel shuttle to get us to the U of Tampa and back for college tour as well as to Channelside free of charge. Worked for me!"	Thank you for choosing the Westin Tampa Harbour Island Chefette! It was a pleasure to have had you and your family with us here at the Westin. Our staff takes pride in providing personal and renewing experiences to each of our guests that leave them feeling better than they did when they arrived. Magda is one of our exceptional associates that takes pleasure in assisting our guests with whatever they may need and goes beyond to ensure a personal and renewing experience for each of our guests. Thank you for the wonderful comments about your stay with us at the Westin Tampa Harbour Island!	4	August 3, 2012	N/A
The room was small compared to North American standards, but most are. Menu prices were high and not too appealing. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Temp setting of 23 was too low. If you set it higher, it would cut out and reset at 23.	Dear Guest, Thank you for your review, I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay overall. The next time you are visiting Glasgow please feel free to contact me direct - niall_oshaughnessy@jurysinns.com. Regards, Niall O’Shaughnessy Deputy General Manager	4	20 June 2015	24 June 2015
Brill stay for mid term, Ita was brill with the kids at club. Captain Jack show was fab as well. Def be back again. Kids well catered for. :-) food excellent no need for leaving hotel. Lovely rooms plenty of towels. Everyone need catered for.	Dear Guests Thank you for writing this wonderful review on your recent visit over mid term with us. Your comments have been shared with all the team and I know the staff at the Kids Club and Ita are overjoyed as it is always nice to receive some praise and a personal mention and it is well deserved. We hope you decide to visit us soon again and continue to enjoy some quality family time together here at the Gleneagle. Many Thanks & Kind Regards Caroline Papin Guest Relations Manager	5	30 October 2013	12 November 2013
Whilst the location is good, the rooms lack an outlook and are a little dated and not clean enough. The pool is too small for the amount of accommodation offered and therefore unable to cater to adults during peak season due, to the enormous amount of children occupying it. Overall very ordinary.	Dear Kim K, thank you for your feedback, I'm sorry that you weren't able to relax and enjoy the pool and surrounds whilst you were staying with us. Occasionally during peak times such as school holidays and weekends the pool area can get very busy and lively with families. I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back again so that you can relax and unwind. Kind Regards, D'orne Fitzpatrick General Manager	3	15 January 2015	N/A
We flew in to Sydney a day early to shake the jet lag and chose the Holiday Inn one block away from where our cruise was to depart from the next day. Location gets a 10 because it is right in the middle of everything. The room was spacious, clean and quiet. The food was palatable, but nothing (good) to write about. But the thought of not having complimentary coffee just didn’t sit well with me. I now know it appears to be common to pay dearly for a cup of joe, or at least in the CBD.	Hello AI T, Thank you for your review of the hotel and location. We agree our location is perfect for visitors to Sydney and gives many advantages to the ferries/ships and attractions. And thank you for your feedback about our F&B services I will look into this with the team. This feedback is very helpful and gives us a chance to refine our offering. Maybe you didnt know but our Coffee is included complementary during breakfast. We do hope you return to Sydney in the future and again choose us. Cheers Dave	4	8 May 2019	9 May 2019
	Hello Grant M, Many thanks for your lovely review and please accept my apologises with the issues you experienced on arrival. I am happy to hear that you will not be put off choosing to stay with us again. See you again next time. Happy Holidays! Best Wishes, Louise	5	14 December 2015	N/A
We have nothing bad to say about this hotel. We were especially pleased with the staff in general and Silvana in particular. She was very friendly and helpful. She went out of the way to give us the information we needed. The room, and breakfast were great. It's not located in the middle of town but if you take the light rail just 3 stops you are in the middle of everything.	Thank you so much for this lovely review of your recent stay at the Ashling Hotel. I was so pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that you found Silvanna helpful. She is delighted with the mention, and hopes to welcome you back to us if you return to Ireland. Kind Regards Alan Moody General Manager	5	20 September 2014	N/A

We were met with a warm welcome by the young lady behind the bar & given a menu advising of wonderful food selection. The Real food didn't disappoint & was plentiful & delicious. The location is stunning, overlooking the Menai Straits. Will certainly be returning!	Thank you for your review, thank you for choosing to dine with us and it is pleasing to hear you had a wonderful experience. We look forward to hosting you again.	5	4 December 2019	15 December 2019
There are no hotels closer to the Denver airport so we found several within a 30 minute wait for pickup. The crown plaza won out because they had rooms and it appeared they were not price gouging because of the weather being so bad. The Hotel Shuttle worked fine but don’t expect the driver to load and unload your bags. He never got out of his seat and that’s ok. Check in was a bit confusing as it was a last minute reservation but the gal worked through the computer snag / issue and smiled the whole time so that was ok. Got to my room and it was located next to a emergency exit in a tiny alcove with another room directly across from mine. And that was ok too. But what’s not ok is when the Hotel policy is NO SMOKING in rooms or inside hotel period and the room across is burning up spliffs like I might as well have been in Jamaica. I don’t care if someone likes their dope or booze, but when it affects my stay, that’s not ok and the Hotel basically didn’t do a thing. Not saying I won’t come back to this hotel as sometimes there’s just no other options but it may not be my first choice of places to stay.	Hello ottersRus! I apologize that we did not meet your expectations for this stay. I will take this feedback directly to my shuttle driver. Additionally, I am sorry that we did not do enough to stop our other guest from affecting your stay. I will be reviewing this with my management team in order to handle these situations better in the future. Thank you for your feedback!	3	December 1, 2018	December 3, 2018
This hotel is more than anyone could ask for, I recently held my sons holly communion party at the Fairlawns, the food was amazing, and the staff were fantastic, nothing was to much, well prices, lovely room, everything was fantastic.	We couldn't ask for more in terms of praise! It was lovely to be involved with such a special occasion and we enjoyed looking after you and the family. As you know - nothing is too much - we look forward to seeing you again soon and looking after you in the same style. John Pette Jnr	5	30 July 2012	N/A

	Dear chocolatecookie123, Thank you for this constructive feedback and kindly accept our apology for the oversights you have identified with our cleaning services, this does not represent our normal high standard of service and warrants investigation internally to ensure this quality of service is not repeated. While vacuuming is not part of our daily service, if there is an obvious need our cleaning staff should take the initiative, we are sorry this didn’t occur during your stay. Yes, there is construction taking place in the courtyard, there is never a good time for this type of work, however we can assure you, once complete, this area is going to be absolutely lovely. We have referred your comment regarding the small green light to our engineering department and have learned that this can be disconnected, as such, thank you for pointing this out. We have scheduled these lights to be disconnected. Our maintenance staff will also inspect the bathroom fan to address the noise issue you have mentioned and make the necessary adjustment. Thank you for noticing, our service staff is fantastic, they enjoy interacting with our guests and doing their part to ensure each guest has the best possible experience. We’re really glad to hear they left a most favorable impression on you. Once again, thank you for your very valuable feedback, your comments allow us to make improvements and achieve our service goals. Yours truly, On behalf of Blue Mountain Resorts Limited Alvard Petten Vice President-Hospitality Services apetten@bluemountain.ca	3	August 29, 2013	September 5, 2013
Definately upgrade to a superior room as these have been refurbished.we were in room 209 which was a large room with a really big bathroom and it overlooked the abbey. we stayed 4-7th november which turned out to be the goth weekend. it was a really busy time with great atmosphere, we foung the food to be quite good value with a fast and efficent service. Drinks were expensive and the entertainment was ok. all staff were really friendly. friends of ours stayed at the same time but their room was a let down as it was in the older part overlooking the car park at the back with old windows. overall i would stay again along as i was in a sea view room.	Thank you for taking the time to leave your comments. Goth weekend are always good fun with a real buzz around the town. As has been mentioned in other reviews the superior/premier rooms are proving to be very popular and definitely worth that little bit extra especially as Whitby has stunning sea and Harbour views. The menus and entertainment plan are prepared with a view to offering something for everyone’s tastes. I hope to welcome you back to the Royal in the near future. Vicki Glen General Manager	3	7 November 2011	8 November 2011
I paid $230 a night here, which was ridiculous for this kind of hotel. Decor is dated, no exterior windows, and it is part of a train station, so you will hear rumbling throughout the night. It is ok if it were $100 cheaper but is a total ripoff for what I paid.	Dear Velvetgemini, Thank you for your your stay and leaving us feedback. We are deeply sorry you found our hotel less than satisfactory. The feedback we receive from our valued guests, like you, enables us to target problem areas. We welcome any opportunity to improve. If there is anything we can do to make your next stay more comfortable, please do not hesitate to ask the Manager on Duty. Sincerely, Jaime W Case Manager IHGCare	3	May 9, 2012	N/A
Stayed here for three nights, the pros of the hotel is that it is reasonably priced and breakfast is good (although breakfast ends at 9am), the rooms are ok and well equiped but I would not describe them as luxurious. The cons of the hotel is that they haven't bothered to clean the pools so they are full of bits of palm trees and other debris. I am not sure if they want guests to use them since they only turn on the water circulation which is a little waterfall at meal times and then they turn it off. The other con is that it is quite a walk to the restaurants and shops, it is walkable but takes about 20 minutes.	Thank you for your comments. They assist us in identifying issues which we may not be aware of. The motor inn is 30 years old and previous owners have not maintained the building or fixtures. We purchased the property 4 years ago and have spent around $1m dollars in renovations and new furnishings for which we receive many good comments on. Our breakfast times are geared towards the type of guest we have. Most tours depart by 8.00am and as travellers are heading either for Rockhampton Townsville or Cairns and these are up to 7 /8 hour drives, guests depart early. Our sale reps also leave early. We are called Colonial Palms and the palms create fronds 4/5 times a year where they range from fine fur to seeds which continually drop into the pool. Pool specialists check the water quality weekly. The water feature is timed for breakfast and dinner. It is not part of the filtering system and if left on all day would result is huge water losses thru evaporation from sun and wind. The main street is 750 meters from our property	3	13 October 2016	N/A
this regency town house has been sympathetically restored and offers a friendly comfortable experience. good breakfast buffet and just around the corner is the splendidly over the top regency tavern which does food at lunchtime and in the evening. the beach and the atmospherically burnt out west pier are minutes away. there is a carpark in the square and a good range of shops and restaurants five minutes away. all you need for a stay in brigton.	Thank you so much for your kind review of Brighton House. We really are pleased you enjoyed your stay with us and look forward to welcoming you back soon in the future. Please remember to mention you are a return guest to get a 10% discount on your new booking.	5	9 June 2011	N/A
We were met on arrival and made very welcome with tea, coffee and hot mince pies! Our room exactly as described on website. Only one negative which was a hiccup I believe with the rad in the bathroom. Brilliant hair dryers though! Variety of breakfast second to none. Great staff. Will return again next year.	Thank for your kind comments - we love to welcome guests with a little sweet treat and a cup of tea after their long journey. I apologise that we had problems with the towel radiator in the Bathroom. This has now been fixed. We look forward to seeing you again next year for your second visit.	4	4 December 2014	6 December 2014
The staff (front desk) was welcoming and courteous during breakfast. House keeping was helpful when I needed additional items and during cleaning of the room. Outside was kept clean and issue's with parking.	Hi Mobile605039, Thank you for taking the time to share your review and experience. We are overjoyed to discover the positive impression we made with our service and hospitality. It means so much to us to hear your positive comments regarding our staff hospitality.

Staff was incredibly helpful extremely helpful. Room 2as clean. Location was okay. This hotel is next to a graveyard. Nothing nearby. The Quay was not far but I would not stay here again. There are about a hundred B&B places in the vicinity. Go there I stead.	Dear Dawn W, Thank you very much for your review and for your feedback on our extremely helpful staff and the cleanliness of the Hotel. I am sorry to hear you were disappointed with our location. The Harbour Hotel is a three minute walk from Shop Street, the bustling and atmospheric Quay street and the historic Spanish Arch. The three minutes also make a difference as one gets to avoid the noise some revellers make this time of year especially during the busy Racing and Arts Festivals. There is a graveyard near the hotel, which is steeped in history and a fascinating local guide gives a detailed account of it, indeed people who have reviewed it have given it an overall score of 4.5 stars out 5! The quayside right beside the hotel is where Galway Bay Boat tours organise daily guided tours of Galway Bay allowing you to experience the Wild Atlantic Way from a completely different perspective. Its regrettable that you didn’t get to discover this part of Galway but should you have the chance to visit again the hotel team would be more than happy to give you a tour of all to do on this great side of Galway City. I hope we will get to welcome you back in the future. Kind regards, Ali McHugh General Manager	3	31 July 2019	N/A
Always the perfect choice when attending anything at the convention or exhibition centre. Second stay for these reasons and both with kids 12 and 14. Direct access to the convention centre through a 1st floor door, you don’t even have to walk outside which is great at night with kids. Although the south Wharf precinct is great and I feel completely safe walking there at night as it is very family oriented. Absolutely love the comfy beds and decor and rooms are always cleaned to perfection. Great views and staff make this hotel a great choice.	Dear TamB76, Thank you very much for posting a review following your stay at Pan Pacific Melbourne. I was delighted to note from your ratings that you enjoyed the room and your overall stay. I greatly appreciate your positive feedback on our decor, staff and location! We are indeed superbly located and I am very pleased you find it extremely convenient.

We stayed with John + Mary at the Bay View last Fri and Sat. night. From the time we arrived we were greeted warmly, and shown our rooms. The rooms were really lovely and comfortable, nicely decorated. Each morning we had a lovely breakfast to set us up for our day cycling. Sat. night we had a section of the hotel to have a lovely sing song away from the bar which had another party going on, overall I would highly recommend the Bay View to groups of individuals, you won't be disappointed. Frances Hynes	Dear Frances, Thank you for taking the time to review us here at The Bay View, it's greatly appreciated!

"We arrived the afternoon before a cruise out of Tampa, to spend the night here. We chose this hotel as they have a package for the room, parking of your vehicle, and transportation to the port the day of the cruise. While there is no free breakfast, they do have a few, varied items on a breakfast menu. Food was fine. Staff is friendly and helpful. This is not fine dining, but hits the spot if you just need "" something!"" There is also a nice size gathering area if you are traveling with a group. There is also a bar and snack menu and light dinner menu ( salads, soups, sandwiches). They open early ( 6 -10am), and stay open around 6 til 10:30 pm, each evening. Rooms were clean, comfortable, and easy to get to from the parking lot. There are about 120 rooms here. Suites are available. Elevators are efficient. We would stay here again if departing for a cruise or flying out of the airport."	Hello Brewer4, Thank you so much for your comments. We appreciate your sharing information with regards to our hotel. We do have a variety of offerings in our Bistro and serve Breakfast and Dinner 7 days a week. We also have a Market for those late night munchies.

Also our beautiful courtyard provides a nice space to enjoy a beautiful sunny Tampa day. We hope that should your travels bring you back to Tampa that you will look us up. Have a wonderful week!	4	January 15, 2016	N/A

Stayed for just 2 nights and upon check in was told that we were upgraded to a luxury room - can't imagine what the regular rooms were! The room was small and we were charged extra for parking. The food In the cafeteria was awful and overpriced. Would NOT recommend this hotel.	Dear Kirsteen A, Thank you for taking the time to post comments about your recent stay.

Chateau on the Lake used to be the primo spot to stay in the Branson area. I visited with my sister and daughter for a quick get away on 6/9 and we were all underwhelmed with our stay. Upon driving up, it had a faded appearance and looked in need of paint and general attention. We were checked into room 706 (2 queen beds). The view in the distance was nice, but the rooms on this side overlook the air-conditioning units which were an eyesore and also made it very noisy through the night. The decor in the room was very, very dated: butterscotch colored walls with a lot of texture, cheap furnishings and very basic amenities. For $250 a night I was expecting more. Our beds had only sheets and a light-weight coverlet-no duvets and no extra blankets or pillows were provided in the room. The best thing we can say is that the mattresses were comfortable and the outdoor pool and hot tub were nice. Chateau on the Lake is more of a hotel than a resort. We dined in the restaurant and it was also disappointing in atmosphere and food quality. If this place wants to compete with Big Cedar, they really need to do some major updating.	Dear JJworkandplay: On May 17th of this year the Chateau celebrated her 17th birthday. She certainly is deserving of additional tender loving care and plans are well under way for her to get just that. We just had all of our mattresses, box springs and bed frames replaced, granite tops on our bedroom case goods, sateen linen 300 tc and new phones. Later this fall there is much more to be done and early next year. Don't give up on the old lady until the fat lady sings. We look forward to welcoming you back. Sincerely, Stephen Marshall General Manager	3	June 10, 2014	July 4, 2014

What a pleasant surprise! We stayed at Lynina Inn along with 30 or so military buddies for a mini Reunion. The location was perfect. Close to most everything. Great value for your money. The rooms are very clean and the bed was comfortable. My husband and I had a good nights rest. Our room was quiet. The staff and housekeeping were awesome. Breakfast had a lot of food choices. The food area was kept very clean. My husband especially enjoyed the evening snack of cookies and ice cream. We will definitely return.	Dear Kelly G, It was so great having you stay with us. It was a privilege to host the Navy Seawolves and we all truly enjoyed talking with all of you and hearing your stories. Thank you so much for the wonderful review and for your service. Thank you, Lynina Inn	5	September 16, 2015	N/A
Had a wonderful two night stay here with extra special touches being included in the Valentine's package we got, with beautifully decorated room with rose petals and woa bottle of prosecco, two full Irish breakfasts and a three course dinner included in the stay.

My Best Regards, Bastien. 	5	17 February 2020	18 February 2020
Had a great stay here Very good location, few minutes drive to Bunbury. Good base to visit Ferguson Valley swine region. Hotel was a little dated and needs some modernisation, however it is clean and has everything you need. All staff were friendly from the reception to the staff and breakfast and the room cleaners. Breakfast was also good with the usual hot choices, several bakery options, yoghurt fruit and cereals, a great start to the day. Would like to use again the next time in the area.	Brian, thank you so much for you review! It is great that our location helped you exploring the region during your trip. We are also very pleased to know you have enjoyed your stay with us and we appreciate the compliments on staff, food and cleanliness. About the modernization, our new owners have exciting plans for the upcoming months. Hoping to see you again on your next visit to Bunbury!	4	19 August 2018	N/A
	Dear msawas, What a wonderful review about your experience following your stay at The Piccadilly London West End. We are pleased and proud to see your review and glad to know that you had wonderful experience. We look forward to welcome you again in recent future Warm Regards Prashant Marne	5	16 April 2017	27 April 2017
We really enjoyed our 2 night stay in this hotel. As it was our honeymoon we got a room on the 9th floor with the best view ever. The mountains around the hotel are incredible. The room was great, a nice and comfortable bed. Not the newest stuff but perfect for a 2 night stay. The rooms are not noisy. We had 2 night dinner at the panarama restaurant. This experience was funny and particular. The food was excellent but the service was the worst ever. In the hotel 4 interns were serving and everything went wrong what could go wrong. Everybody was complaining about the service, but the interns did their best. For sure overpriced although the quality of the food compensated this a little. Overall we had two funny dinners.....	Dear Chris255113, Thanks for taking the time to write a review about your recent experience at The Hermitage. I'm so please that you enjoyed your honeymoon with us and a big congratulations from the team here at The Hermitage. I was a little concerned at the fact that we had interns all working at the same time, this should not be happening and I guess you saw why! I have already followed this up with the Food & Beverage Manager to ensure we do not have a repeat of this and to ensure that any new staff are properly trained before serving any tables without proper supervision. Thanks for your understanding on this, others may not have found it so funny! Congratulations again, I hope we may be able to welcome you back on an anniversary some time in the future. Kind regards, Andrew Cleverley General Manager	4	3 August 2010	N/A
We stayed here for five days out of the school holiday season. We asked for a spot near the beach but in hindsight this was a mistake as it seemed to be where the over night RV's were put, so it was busy. Unfortunately we copped a load of foreign overnighters who arrived after midnight and made enough noise to wake the whole camp, then decided to sit and loudly chat till another camper told them to be quiet. Next time we would ask for a spot at the back of the park, much nicer area and grassy. The park is busy,as most of the over nighters are there to see the penguin parade, there are lots of cabins. The staff are very friendly. The amenities were old but clean and could do with a revamp but there are plenty of them. There is a playground and jumping mat for the kids, a pool would be good as the beach is not really good for swimming. The camp kitchen though is fabulous. There are heaps of little rabbits about and water birds but they added to the charm.	We appreciate your comments on your recent stay with us at BIG4 Phillip Island Caravan Park. We are pleased your enjoyed the Parks facilities and got to see some of our local wildlife. We apologise that you experienced some discomfort during your stay. We strive to make everyone's stay with us an enjoyable one so we have taken on board your comments to assist us in improving our operations. Thankyou again for your feedback and hope to see you again in the future.	4	13 February 2015	N/A
We had been dying to here for ages and finally bit the bullet when we say a weekend offer on their website. From the moment we arrived we were made feel welcome and upgraded to a suite which was amazing! They got everything right with this hotel, the attention to detail is everywhere and the staff are so well trained and so polite. The food is just gorgeous and we wanted for nothing all weekend. This was the most realxed I have ever been on a weekend break, we barely left our suite except to eat as we wanted for nothing. One of my favourite hotels	Dear Reviewer. Thank you for your lovely review and I am delighted to read your kind comments regarding our staff, food and the hotel in general. I look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back to the Slieve Russell in the future. Kind regards, Tony Walker.	5	20 November 2012	N/A
Great to be back in Armidale on a chilly winter's night. The room was a single which came at a very reasonable rate under $100. Single room was small compared to the others, but it is perfect for the single traveller. Great location, quiet rooms despite being on a main road, strong hot shower and friendly service. See you next year.	Thank you so much for leaving your comments. It's always great to hear that our guests have enjoyed their stay, especially on chilly Armidale nights. Look forward to seeing you again.	4	4 July 2014	9 August 2014
	Wow, thank you so much for your wonderful review. I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that everyone took such good care of you. I am also pleased that you liked your suite as well as our sumptuous breakfast buffet. We look forward to seeing you again soon!	5	February 3, 2015	February 6, 2015
Other than the customer service venue is quite good, rooms are large, bar staff extremely nice and accommodating but the management only cared for the bottom line $$$ our room aircon didn’t go below 22 and nothing was done about it	Dear guest, Thank you for providing feedback on the air con unit, this will be followed up to our facilities team. Would you be so kind in emailing me directly your apartment number on this email address ammarket@theoaksgroup.com.au	4	4 February 2018	8 February 2018
A very good experience overall. A lovely building and superbly done up as a hotel. Dinner and the associated service was not quite up to our expectations, but the management handily and helpfully dealt with that for us. The spa is lovely, but limited to steam room and treatments (i.e. no sauna or pool).	Thank you for taking the time to give us feedback on your recent stay at Mondrian London. I am sorry to hear you experienced some minor service issues at dinner but am happy you felt this dealt with efficiently by the management. agua really is the most wonderful spa and offers our guests a playful twist on a Roman bath house with a healthy dose of Glamrock., all served with an inventive menu including champagne, strawberries and a chocolate fondue! It truly is a spa like no other and is receiving such amazing press. I hope we may welcome you back to Mondrian London in the future. Warm regards, Anne	4	4 November 2014	5 November 2014
We went for three nights, and since the check in was terrible! The man was unkind and made a lot of mistakes during check in. Then the room; we booked a suite, was big but not good, dirty carpet and with scratches, the towels too and nasty odor. We paid so much money for a very bad room! Then food....bad, worst and TERRIBLE and very expensive! The meat you can't eat it, like plastic, burgers like bad fast food. Then in the fine dinner restaurant they don't served the wine at the table like should be, very unpleasant and horrible service, like in a cheap restaurant. Buffet breakfast bad too, service was TERRIBLE the waitress leave the plates all the time we had to take them to another place because our table was full with dirty dishes and to bring us coffee and juice, took forever. The concierge always busy and rude. And check out, the worst experience too, it is a very, very expensive place and after all, they made a lot of wrong charges, of course against us. All we have to say of this place is bad, worst and TERRIBLE!!!	Aloha, Thank you for staying with us and sharing your feedback. It’s very disappointing to hear that your room accommodation and dining experiences did not meet your expectations. In the future, if you are ever unhappy with your stay, please don’t hesitate to call upon us. We have staff standing by 24/7 to ensure your satisfaction. We do hope you will consider staying with us again. Warmest aloha, Danna Holck Vice President & General Manager	1	October 26, 2014	N/A
We chose Peepers Manor House to celebrate our 40 th Wedding Anniversary. We noticed a couple of reviews that rated the service in the restraint poorly but we found everything to be satisfactory, friendly efficient and easy going.	Dear John M, thank you for such a great review of your recent stay with us. I am very happy to read that you found the service in Katers to be satisfactory friendly and efficient. We very much look forward to welcoming you back soon! Kind regards, Federico Solchi Front Office Manager Peppers Manor House	4	17 October 2016	22 October 2016
The rooms were nice but the single beds are way to small for adults... The service was excellent, views amazing.. Very close to Boat Club, had a lovely dinner there saturday night.. Recommend the Bistro at the Boat club for a meal...	We appreciate you taking the time to review our fabulous hotel. It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed yourself. Thank you for sharing.	4	15 May 2017	3 June 2017
Hotel rooms are decorated really fun. Loved discovering new things every time we went back in the room. The kids and parents both loved the individual spaces and the layout of the room. Perfect trip for our kids (ages 4 and 9). Everything seemed tailored for this age group. Hotel entertainment was great. So casual and friendly. Food was good too. Loved that there was a kid-sized buffet that offered a good variety of healthy choices. Great experience overall and a memorable trip for everyone!	What a pleasure it is to hear that from start to finish, you were not disappointed. Providing quality service with a fun and welcome atmosphere is what we are all about. Therefore, we are glad that we could offer that you and we thank you for recommendations, which are so valuable to us. We hope future visits will bring back that special memories that you made on this trip. Thank you for your posting.	5	June 3, 2015	N/A
Myself and my partner have stayed here on a couple of occasions over the past 18 months. The hotel is beautiful. Both times we have received a modern room which is very comfy. Best bit of the trip - the spa! Pool is lovely and it's great being able to access the outdoor poor without every leaving the indoor pool, very romantic when you get this to yourself. The different areas in the spa are well kept and have never been busy when we were there which is another plus. Dinner is a bit pricey in restaurant but we ate in the bar one night and enjoyed the great atmosphere. Cannot wait to visit again early next year.	Dear KarenStorie85 Thank you for your lovely Trip Advisor Review and indeed your loyalty to Farnham Estate! It's great to read such lovely feedback and myself and the team really appreciate it. I do hope that you will get the chance to visit us again soon and we certainly look forward to welcoming you back. Kind regards Andrew Drysdale General Manager	5	5 August 2015	N/A
I have stayed twice in the last three weeks for busines and will stay again. Friendly and attentive front of house staff, easy to check in and out, great central location, great breakfast.

"What an amazing experience we had staying at The Francis and experiencing everything Ucluelet and Tofino have to offer. The Francis sent a personal email after we booked online and gave us a list of ""must-do"" adventures in the area. Without their help our little vacation would not have been as great as it was! The room we had was GORGEOUS with a great view - sparkling clean with everything you could ever need. It was private and quiet. The hot tub in the back was also very clean and nice to soak in at the end of the day. The owners were outstanding and made you feel comfortable and right at home. We hope to come back to the area next year for another little vacation - but extend our time there. We will definitely be staying at the Francis! Stop looking around for other places to stay - The Francis is definitely the spot to stay."	WOW!!! We're humbled. I'm not sure how to add anything more; other than a sincere thank you. Loved hosting you guys!! Regards Sandra & Brent	5	August 15, 2017	August 24, 2017
Enjoyed a few drinks in here with my Mum aftercan afternoon tea in another large hotel chain around the corner. The service in here was 2nd to none. From the minute we walked through the doors staff couldn't have done any more for us. Collecting wrt coats and hanging them up for us. Bringing ice cold water (and continually topping it up throughout the evening). Delicious salt & pepper popcorn given to nibble on. The ambience of this hotel/bar was amazing. Low lighting, soft music & candles burning. Toilets were spotless, with lovely hand soap & towels to dry hands on. We cannot wait to return.	Dear 123travel12 Thank you for your lovely review of Dakota Bar and Grill. It is a pleasure to read you came in with your mother for a few drinks in the bar and found the service second to none. I am delighted you enjoyed the ambience we create and that the staff looked after you so well. Attentive staff and stylish surroundings are some of the hallmarks of Dakota so it is good to know we are achieving what we set out to do and that you would love to return. Hopefully we will have the pleasure of welcoming you back soon,	5	15 April 2018	N/A
This is a brand new Hotel with all the bells and whistles! The rooms are very spacious with great Wi-Fi speed. The breakfast area and lobby are very inviting. They have an outdoor grilling area with a basketball goal for guest use. I especially liked being able to walk a couple hundred feet to get a drink and some food at Hickory Tavern.	Hello Sachingp, thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. Very glad to here that you enjoyed your stay with us. The entire team will be happy to hear the glowing review of our hotel.

I have stayed with break free at many locations but in adelaide usually stay at hindley where I have always had no complaint except the noise from the street. Not planing my trip this time I left it to the last minute to book and my partner booked it over the iphone in the car . I was at first disapointed at not being able to get in my favourite hotel but know think it doesnt matter where I stay as long as its with breakfree. Thankyou for a comfortable stay	Thank you for taking the time to review your stay. I am pleased to read that you enjoyed your stay. I will also share your comments with the team, I am sure they will be happy to read your comments regarding your stay.	5	19 October 2011	N/A
I stayed here for four nights and to summarize the experience I would say that the restaurant serves great quality food at dinner, the 5:00pm free cocktail social is such a good idea (you can really get to know people), the staff is very helpful and the location is very peaceful. You will get really great pictures at dusk and dawn too. This is a laid back place and I enjoyed my time there.	Dear MsCShangha, Thank you very much for staying with us at the Reef House in Palm Cove. We really appreciate your review and it is so pleasing to read that you had an enjoyable time with us. It also sounds like you were able to settle into our Colonial Beach House way of life with great food served in a picturesque setting with nice friendly people. Thank you again MsCShangha, we hope you enjoy the rest our your holiday ! Tropical Regards Wayne Harris General Manager	4	13 February 2019	N/A
We stayed one overnight to catch an early flight out of Dublin Airport. The lobby is festive and comfortable, with the restaurant directly adjacent to it. We arrived in the early evening, and surprised to see a long line of people checking in. There were no seats to take, as they were all filled with dinner guests, so we stayed jam packed with the crowd until we saw a chair open up. Clean rooms, and bathrooms, free WiFi throughout hotel, very close to Dublin airport. Went downstairs to eat dinner and print out our boarding passes, to be surprised with check in guests taking up most the seats this time. Took a few minutes to find a table to eat. I think the hotel should reconsider how their lobby functions. After dinner, and paying to use their computer and printer, I realized our boarding passes weren't that legible and may not be accepted at the airport, due to the faded ink on the barcode. Front desk said they couldn't help, or print on their end, and that the airport would indeed accept the tickets. *no, they actually didn't. Thanks, Clayton staff.	Dear Lalaine, Thank you for choosing the Clayton Hotel Dublin Airport for your recent stay. We aim to provide a very high level of hospitality and service and I am sorry to hear we did not live up to your expectations and am sorry to hear about the lack of seating for you to avail of int he lobby area to have your evening meal. We are thrilled to hear that you found the rooms to be up to your expectations. Again I do apologise about the issue with your boarding passes as if there are ever any issues with the printers not working in the lobby we can print them from the front desk. This issue will be passed on to the front desk manager.Once again I can only profusely apologise for the inconvenience you were caused and hope it will not deter you from returning to the hotel where perhaps this could afford us the opportunity to win back your trust and goodwill. We would love to be your host again in the future at the Clayton Hotel Dublin Airport. Kind Regards, Anne-Marie	3	20 November 2016	N/A

Enjoyed our stay which was very comfortable. The staff was very helpful and the complementary breakfast buffet was a bonus delight. My complements to the chef for cooking up a delicious omelet with chilli flakes! The bus passes were really appreciated on the way back to the hotel from a 10km hike!

We stayed for one night on sunday. Mature couple. Very relaxing friendly welcome. Room was spacious and A/C was comfortable. Good selection of room service and downstairs bar and restaurant are stocked well with good selection of both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. Only 5 min by taxi from the central station. Overall, very good experience. Will visit again.	Dear Rambul, Thank you for taking the time to review your Sunday night stay at Hilton Glasgow and for awarding us full marks.

I have shared your great comments with our team and we look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Kind regards, Daniel van Wyk Hotel Manager	5	24 September 2015	29 September 2015
Spent two nights here in August. Staff are lovely, especially Lucy who made us very welcome. Room no. 3 - tiny arty sea view with balcony. Decor is a little tired looking. Room is small but adequate. They provide ear plugs which are very much needed. Very noisy until around 2 am. Room very hot - a fan would have been welcome. Breakfast was excellent. Good quality products cooked beautifully. The Cocktail Shack is brilliant. Max the manager is a pure genius. He's so knowledgeable and friendly with it. A great asset to the hotel. Had dinner in The Set. 5 courses with matching wines. Excellent food and service by Devon who was lovely. Different flavours, amazing presentation. All good! Would def stay here again. But it's not for those looking for somewhere quiet! Wifi did not work in our room.	Dear Oggiesj, Thank you for staying with us for two nights in August. We are thrilled to hear that you had a great stay with us, especially that you enjoyed all of your food and drinks while you were with us. Sorry to hear that your room was on the noisy side. Our lively restaurant does mean that some noise can travel up to some of the rooms on the first floor. There are, however, plenty of very lovely and perfectly quiet rooms on the upper three floors of the hotel. We do have fans that we are always happy to provide to our guests on hotter nights but we apologise if this wasn't made clear to you. We would love to welcome you back to the hotel soon! Best regards, Celia	4	24 August 2015	1 September 2015
I was here for the first time for a conference and this place is great. The rooms are very spacious and the staff is friendly. The pools they have are perfect for relaxing and enjoying the landscape.

Booked this hotel on the suggestion of my son. He stayed here before and liked it. From start to finish everything was great. Check in staff friendly and efficient. Rooms / linens clean. Beds very comfortable. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had- lots of choices from cold cereal to yogurt, eggs, sausage, fruit, etc. Lots of choices for someone who can not eat bread products (gluten). Really liked the roasted seasoned potato cubes. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Will now be on our list of places to stay in Branson. Only thing I would change would be the size of the refrigerator- it was one of those real small ones (two foot tall at best). Could not store much in it.	Thank you for the positive review, nuprofessor! We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay and the breakfast options! We hope you have a wonderful day and we look forward to your next visit!	5	October 2, 2018	N/A
Reasons why this hotel is amazing: - Staff is committed to delighting their guests, they greet you warmly upon arrival are personable and helpful. - The location is great, I was here for a conference, it's easy to get in and out of the area and there is great food all around you. - The rooms are well appointed. The room I was in (King Premier) has beautiful furnishings, a comfortable bed, lots of plugs for electronics, and a small fridge. What really sets this place apart from every other hotel? The clean and soft bathrobes in the bathroom, they are luxurious and I am definitely purchasing one (I always thought this was a silly option, until now.) I love that the hotel utilizes shampoo dispensers and bottles of soap in the bathroom, I love that we are preventing more useless waste by not using tiny little shampoo bottles that you only use a bit of, and then get thrown away. I absolutely love the plugs in the side of the bedside tables, and the little reading lamps in the headboard of the bed. Also, they offer group fitness classes, that is awesome! Ultimately the Seaport Hotel's attention to detail is unparalleled in comparison with the many other places I have stayed. There isn't a single thing that was out of place or slightly unsatisfactory. Also, free WIFI, why do other places not have this!? Thank you Seaport, stay classy.	Thank you for your recent visit and for your very comprehensive review. We have received a good deal of positive feedback about our shampoo and conditioner dispensers – it’s nice to hear you appreciated them - and they are environmentally-friendly, as you mentioned. We do hope we can welcome you back again. Thank you for taking the time to provide a review. Kind regards, James M. Carmody Vice President & General Manager	5	July 14, 2015	N/A
The apartment had plenty of room with everything supplied, including washing machine and dryer for a three day stay. The resort was close to water activities including Frazer Island tours and whale watching.	Dear Longchany Thank you so much for your lovely review of your recent stay.

We stayed first week in December very low occupancy because the Queensland school holidays dont start till week 2. Very nice room with all we need to cook for ourselves.

From booking to checkout the staff was friendly, helpful and professional. The added services of long term parking while we travelled, shuttle service and in room kitchenette made for a great stay. If you are flying out of Victoria this is a convenient place to stay.	Thank you so much for your great review. We hope we can be of service to you again next time you visit.	4	February 22, 2017	February 27, 2017
Stayed here last week as part of the Travelzoo offer and although we enjoyed our stay ,there were some disappointing aspects .The place itself is stunning and the public rooms are lovely. It is nice that you can wander around and the staff are all very helpful [we were surprised by the lady who checked us out however -she was very cool and didn't even ask us if we had enjoyed our stay! )I agree with the comments about the carpet but it's just a poor colour choice and probably not really that dirty . Our room (Telford Room) was very nice but the outlook wasn't very pleasant and when my partner had a shower the bathroom flooded and it put me off having one ..We had 2 single beds pushed together which wasn't very comfortable .I would rather have been told it was 2 singles and slept separately than having a ridge down the middle.The dining experience was very pleasant -nice food and good company .Good service from a very pleasant Frenchman.The breakfast the next morning however was very substandard. The fruit salad was dull,the scrambled eggs inedible and the most surprising thing of all -INSTANT coffee -definitely not 5 or even 4 star.I would love to go back and stay in a different room if these details were rectified.	Dear Samemmal, Thank you for your recent review of your stay, It is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed the meal in the evening and I shall ensure that I congratulate Daniel on your behalf. In terms of the other key points, I have requested that maintenance look at the draining of the shower and that the Breakfast team receive the necessary remedial training to ensure the consistency of our breakfast. With this in mind, I must apologise but please be assured that on this occasion it fell short of the normal high standard. I hope that we can welcome you back again soon. With best wishes, Martin Martin Page General Manager	4	18 May 2014	N/A
Everything about this park was immaculate, even the gardens. Great spot in the gap in Alice amongst the ranges. Lots of free activities and good little shop that even sold alcohol. Very pricy but so is similar parks in the area during peak season. Also nice for staff to personally escort you to your caravan site. Huge park	Hi JaffaoF, thanks for your review, we are pleased that you enjoyed our park and our well stocked shop! we hope to see you in our little slice of paradise again soon.	5	12 June 2017	14 June 2017
Great place for a family to stay w a restaurant. Clean, super spacious w 2 bedrooms & sleep 5 (1queen, 1single & a double deck bed), full kitchen, washing machine. It's near the Promenade (beach) too but it's too cold today for us. Ashley is outstandingly friendly just like all the others I've met in this trip!!!	Thank you ChrizLim for your great review! Ash is our newest team member here and he has hit the ground running! He has been doing a sensational job in his new role and we are very proud.

The two cabins we had booked were both great quality, comfortable beds, quiet night, clean & tidy presentation. The park managers made us feel welcome (thanks Craig & Kerry). Will be coming back with the family in the summer for sure. Highly recommended.	Thanks Rhiannon for your great feedback.We are so pleased you enjoyed your recent stay and found everything to your liking. Making our guests feel welcome is all part of our park experience and we look forward to many more opportunities to say hi in the future. Our team also really appreciate the fact that you have included a recommendation.	5	20 May 2018	N/A
Good - every member of staff was lovely, all of the food was excellent value and very tasty, everywhere seemed very clean, entertainment was good. Bad - Our tent was situated in an exposed spot by the side of the main road. As such, we didn't sleep much any night and were constantly tired. It is a long walk to the toilet blocks from some locations. It's not at all clear where to park on arrival. Disappointing. We are not sure if we would want to return.	Dear Guest, Thank you for your review. We are pleased to hear that the staff were friendly. We are sorry that Fairway was not suitable for you; if we had had availability we would have moved you to another area. If you do re-book please mention that you did not like Fairway and we will put a note on your booking.	3	29 July 2015	4 August 2015
We booked into a superior room here for a bit of luxury after a night in another hotel down the road, and it certainly lived up to expectations. It's the kind of place where you feel a bit spoilt. The staff were lovely and very keen to help (though shame they didn't realise when recommending restaurants on our arrival that sadly most were closed that night being new year's day!). The room was beautifully decorated with a super comfy nice big bed. There's also a non-alcoholic complimentary mini-bar and great powerful shower. And the piece de resistance for me was the robes! Well located centrally too, but on a side street so no problems with noise. It's not cheap, but it was worth it!	Dear Lucy H, Thank you so much for your 5 star review and i am so pleased you enjoyed your visit. Our central location, close to the museums, restaurants and theaters, always rates very highly in our guests comments. I do apologize that our restaurant recommendations for New Years Day evening fell short, i have addressed this with the team. We hope to see you again soon at Vanbrugh House Hotel. Kind regards David Robinson General Manager	5	28 January 2015	N/A
Stayed in this holiday whilst on a self-drive road tour throughout the UK, the hotel offered excellent value for money, therefore have difficulty finding any creditable faults. The only real criticism I have and is applicable to all of the other Holiday Inn’s that we found in the UK is the absence of any mechanical fresh air ability into the room other than opening a window. The was a mechanical ventilation system in the toilet, but did not appear to be working. Other than this, the hotel was fine for a nights stay Pros • Good value for money • Ok Breakfast • Bed was comfortable. Cons • No in-room safe. • No in-room fridge. • Parking availability available in public carpark • No fresh air into the room other than opening a window Conclusion: • Good value for money.	Dear Paddles1964, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us. I am very happy to read that you have enjoyed your stay with us. It's really good to see that you took advantage of our breakfast that we include with all of our rooms and that you liked the room we chose for you. Although there are no in room safes or fridges we have safety deposit boxes for guest use at reception and we would also be able to keep an item of yours in one of our fridges in the kitchen upon request. We look forward to seeing you in the future. Kind regards, James Gourlay, Guest Services Manager.	4	16 July 2016	N/A
Defo worth a visit when staying in London. Great location. Its tight as its central but was enough. Don't expect big space. Comfy bed. Chef should not be seen smoking just outside the hotel/restaurant in a sight. Seeing that we have not ordered only had continental. Nice service. Prosecco on arrival made our evening relaxed before seeing a show. Reception desk very polite and helpful.	Dear MariolaAhaha, Thank you ever so much for your complimenting review following your recent stay with us at The Piccadilly London West End. It gives us great pleasure to read that you had a memorable experience with us. The entire team have received your feedback. This warm comment certainly serves as a wonderful motivator for us all to continue striving for service excellence. Kind Regards,	4	19 December 2019	25 December 2019
From the moment we stepped arrived, we were greeted by welcoming and friendly staff. We were fortunate to be located on the 21st floor in an ocean view room. Although not directly located only the beach (3 minute walk), this hotel provides an escape from the hustle and bustle from the main strip, but is still very close to everything you need. The complimentary breakfast is an assortment of fresh fruits, a variety of pastries and toast, which is a great way to start the day. This hotel was definitely a highlight of our trip and we look forward to coming back in the future.	Hi Lemme01, We appreciate you taking the time out of your day to write a review about your Vive Hotel Waikiki experience. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our hotel, from the staff, to the room and amenities as well as location. We are looking forward to providing you with accommodations again in the future. Thank you for staying with us, take care. Best regards, Michael	5	February 15, 2015	N/A
	We're absolutely delighted you had such an enjoyable & relaxing time away. Your insights are very much appreciated by our entire Powerhouse team & we’re thrilled to hear your husband took the time to visit our Powerhouse Motorcycle Museum. Our volunteers enjoy making each visitor feel welcome & inspired by the bikes! Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We can't wait to see you again at The Powerhouse.	4	9 October 2017	13 October 2017
Hotel was very pretty and grand looking. Nice area only around 15 minutes to get to the centre and rooms were lovely, clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable and didn't hear any noise from other rooms which you usually have in hotels. Staff were very accommodating.	Thank you for your brilliant review of your stay at the Ashling Hotel, Dublin. I was pleased to read that you were impressed by the hotel and that you found our location accessible to the city centre. It was great to read that you were pleased with your room and that you felt our team were accommodating to your needs. We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the nearest future. Best Wishes, Alan Moody General Manager	5	5 March 2019	6 March 2019
New facility, clean, nice breakfast, friendly personnel at check-in, valet parking and maid service. free WiFi, small but clean fitness room with new equipment. Rooftop pool with great view and individual TV's.	Thank you for your review! We are pleased you thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of your stay with us. Should you find yourself back in Savannah, we do hope you will come back for another fantastic stay. Thank you!	5	July 10, 2016	N/A
Beautiful grounds. Very classy entrance to Reception, then it is all downhill from there. Can't really see the bay. Staff friendly but incompetent. Food and wine overpriced. Room service meal cold and congealed. Rooms not well cleaned, furniture stained, very tired and old. The shower just a dribble. Even though you are required to pay for wireless connection it did not work the 3 days we were there. Fortunately the charge was removed from bill. Stay away!	Dear Carol W, I am truly upset to read that your recent stay with us did not meet expectations for numerous reasons. This is certainly not what we strive for here at Pullman Bunker Bay Resort and I would like to extend my sincerest apologies. We do hope you return to stay with again sometime in the near future where we can serve you better. Kind regards, Bronwyn Bulpitt General Manager Pullman Bunker Bay Resort	1	18 February 2015	N/A
"Staying at the Brown Palace was on a ""Bucket List"" so we made it happen this last weekend when on business in Denver, CO. We (3) ate at the Palace Arms and it was even better than we imagined. The service staff is wonderful---helpful, thoughtful, courteous and very knowledgeable about the history of the Brown Palace as well as current details."	Thank you for this raving comment. I am looking forward to share your experience with the service staff of the Palace Arms tonight. We are looking forward to host you at the Brown Palace Hotel and Spa in the near future. With Best Regards, Thomas Gutmann	5	March 5, 2012	N/A
"Having worked in the hotel industry, I am extremly picky about where I stay. This hotel beats any major chain out there. The staff was friendly, greeted us by name every time we entered the lobby and always helpful when asking for directions, and sites to see. The rooms were amazing, we were on the 9th floor and the views were spectatular! I thought at first the hard wood floors were a little odd, but so clean it takes away of the ""fears"" of what might be in the carpets. Walking distance to all the great sites Charlottetown has to offer, we certainly will be booking there again, and telling all of our friends and family to stay there."	Thank you very much for your kind words about our staff and property! We take great pride in providing a friendly and welcoming experience for our guests. We look forward to having you stay with us again in the future.	5	July 12, 2014	N/A
Visited here for a meal after a nice walk. The staff greeted us very politely. It was busy but got a table no problem which was very clean. We ordered at the bar and waited. A lovely waitress brought out cutlery and napkins. We only waited around 30 minutes and our food arrived presentation was second to none and the taste was great. We left with full tummies and left empty plates and a good tip. It is a place we will visit again maybe even stay as they also have rooms available.	Thank you for your review. It is always nice to get such positive comments like yours. I will pass them over to my team as they will give them a great lift over such a busy period for us. All the team and myself look forward to welcoming back at The Valley. Best wishes	5	10 August 2016	N/A
One elevator was out of order the moment we arrived, and the other one broke for almost a day, there were no ladders up to the rooms, and no one was there to help us get to our room, the staff was all grumpy and in bad mood to help us, a guest told us there was a service elevator hidden in the back, and the staff did not like us using that elevator. During all time, the only staff member that was simpathetic and smiley was the reception on our check out, as if the hotel was happy for us to leave...	We understand that first impressions can be lasting impressions and we apologize for the poor service experience you encountered. We've shared your feedback with our staff and additional training opportunities will be available. We value your feedback and your business and hope we can invite you back to our true hospitality. Kind regards, Ximena Coca ximena.coca@hilton.com	2	February 27, 2014	March 6, 2014

The Windsor has never failed to disappoint. The food at the restaurant was excellent, as was the service. I stayed one night and dined for dinner and breakfast. Rooms are clean, quiet and tastefully furnished. The fitness centre has beautiful views of the gardens.	Dear Belinda Sounds close to perfect. We really appreciate your kind consideration in posting such a charming review. Thank you. Looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back soon. Yours sincerly Prue Roderick Front Office Manager	5	14 December 2015	15 December 2015
The wing of this hotel across from the main high-rise is very old and tired. Tiny bathrooms that need to be updated. No views unless you like looking at a parking lot. On the other hand, the location is great with a walkway to the beach. the deli located here is first rate with a wide selection and friendly service. The restaurant in hotel has good food but service is very slow.	Good evening Deborah G, Thank you for giving your feedback for the Bahia Mar Doubletree by Hilton. We appreciate you highlighting several areas you were pleased with and we hope you will accept our apologies for the lack of satisfaction in the category of room accommodations. Frequently trending topics continue to be the focus of our management team and the guest surveys are pivotal in helping us improve. Thank you for posting and have a nice day.

Good location for what I needed. BEST PART: The staff. Everyone from the welcome to the good-bye did a fantastic job making me feel welcome and appreciated. WORST PART: Had some issues getting the bathroom sink faucet fixed; it took two work order requests. Also asked about the bathroom fan being caked with dust, but it didn't seem to be of any concern because it was left alone. Mike at the front desk gave an amazing welcome. My housekeeper showed of her great smile in the hallway, and the girl who managed the gatehouse/breakfast made me feel like we'd been long time friends. All-in-all, this was definitely worth the value.	Dear Srmorris78, Thank you so much for your feedback. Our team is happy to hear that overall you had an enjoyable stay, but we do apologize for those inconveniences you faced. I will make sure to bring this up in our daily meeting. Thank you for choosing TownePlace Suites Denver Southeast. I hope you have a wonderful week. Warm Regards, Tiffany Ramos Sales Manager	4	March 27, 2017	N/A
I recently stayed for 2 nights with my boyfriend in the Galway Bay hotel and I have to say it was a pleasure from start to finish. From the welcoming atmosphere to the excellent service by all the staff it seemed no request was too big. Our room was spacious and very clean and the view of the Promenade from our room was lovely and meant we got a good nights sleep also. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first evening and we couldn't find fault with either the quality of the food or value for money! The manager Peter was accommodating and answered all of our queries and requests in a professional and friendly manner. The hotel is close to the town without giving you the feeling that you're on a city break due to its seaside location. Highly recommend!	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for this wonderful review of the Galway Bay Hotel. I am delighted to view your comments, and I have shared your views with all on the team. All team members here have asked that I pass on a very sincere Galway Bay Hotel ‘thank you.’ You mention Peter in person, he is chuffed (and rightly so) to be mentioned in such a positive light through such a public medium. I do agree with your comments regarding our location. We are very close to the city centre, however in a seaside location so people can ‘get the best of both worlds’ whilst relaxing during a well earned break. Also, we are in the ideal location to base oneself when choosing a location to tour the West of Ireland and Connemara; sitting directly on the promenade, overlooking the beautiful Galway Bay and Clare Hills, with Galway city on one side and of course Connemara on the other side. As you are only too aware we have the blue flag beach outside our door and this is obviously extremely popular with families and couples alike. You mention ‘welcoming atmosphere’ and I am delighted to see this. As a team, we work very hard to achieve this through our in house structured training program – ‘Exceeding Expectations’ – with a primary focus on costumer care and costumer service. I would like to thank you once again and I look forward to welcoming you back to the Galway Bay at some stage in the future. Please do not hesitate to drop me a line at dmurphy@galwaybayhotel.com a I would welcome the opportunity to say hello in person at some stage in the future. Kindest Regards, Dan Murphy .	5	23 July 2010	N/A
We stayed here on Sunday night for the Ed Sheeran concert. We were there at 3pm for check in as we planned to be in town for 4pm. We had an early dinner booked. The reception told us our rooms wouldn't be ready until 4pm! We waited and told them we had reservations and needed one of the rooms to get ready and go. They gave us one room at 3.30pm with a push so we could get ready. We found reception unfriendly and not very helpful. As we were out to the concert for the evening, we didn't get our room key until very late when we returned. The room was lovely and comfortable but check in was a real let down and put us under pressure for the evening. We would have gotten ready at home if we thought check in was late evening! Checking in this late was not good enough and left a bad impression and the reception didn't even make up for it with a good attitude. Breakfast was good the next morning. Overall the hotel is lovely and the breakfast is very good but the check in was terrible.	Many thanks for your review of your stay with us on the Sunday night of the May bank holiday weekend. I sincerely apologise for the delay with your check-in. Our normal check-in time is 3pm although I have to admit this can be a struggle to achieve in every case and particularly on bank holiday weekends as it is dependent on guests vacating their rooms by the check-out time of 12pm. I don't mean this as an excuse by the way, but only as an explanation as to why these delays can sometimes occur. I was equally disappointed to learn of your impression of the front office team. We always concentrate on providing welcoming, friendly and helpful service throughout all areas of the hotel. You clearly didn't find this to be the case in relation to your check-in. I have addressed this point to the staff and management concerned. I can assure you that we have redoubled our efforts to ensure the necessary training and standards are in place to provide consistently excellent service to all our guests. I very much appreciated your kind comments in relation to your room and breakfast. I can fully understand how the poor start to your stay left you with a negative impression, however. I hope you enjoyed the Ed Sheeran concert. We had lots of guests who attended it and everyone I spoke to certainly seemed to have a great time. The good weather helped and the three concerts led to a great atmosphere around the city across the whole weekend. You are very welcome to contact me on fergalharte@thekingsley.ie if you wish to discuss your stay in more detail or if you plan to return to the hotel at any stage. My apologies again and I look forward to hearing from you in due course. Best regards, Fergal Harte General Manager	3	9 May 2018	N/A
Stopped there for one night and found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming never had time to visit the restaurant but loved the feel of the hotel. My room was very spacious and warm and the bathroom was great hot water just like that. My only complaint was the corridor was very noisy the fire doors didn't have a soft close so they used to bang very loud and the floor boards creaked as you walk along them. Overall I would like to stay there again to give the restaurant a go	Dear Mike Y Thank you for taking the time to write a review of The Met on Trip Advisor. It is great to read that you found our staff to be so friendly and that you liked your room. Also thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the corridors, I am disappointed to read this affected your stay however we would be delighted to welcome you back to the hotel again in the future. Yours sincerely Mike Liddle	4	18 October 2016	N/A
Room sizes are excellent, hotel is extremely well located and the staff are first class. Every time I stay in Sydney which is frequently this hotel is one of my top picks. If you are a Sheraton lover you will enjoy this hotel, put it on your list. Of note when I checked inJune was extremely attentive to my needs and was very efficient on my arrival.	Dear Tony C, Thank you for your ongoing patronage and loyalty to Sheraton on the Park! Our associates do indeed endeavour to assist our guests whenever possible and I’m delighted they continue to provide such great customer service. We look forward to welcoming you back to Sheraton on the Park on many more occasions! Warm regards, Bernhard Langer Hotel Manager	5	22 March 2016	24 March 2016
Stayed while on a short holiday visiting family. Best location, close to everything, can walk to get dinner, to the shops and to the beautiful beach. Room was great, nice and spacey, with a spa bath. Super easy to find, great if you do not have a car.	Hi Puppyoverloadxo1, Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I am glad that you enjoyed your stay and Mooloolaba.

Great view of the river, awesome facilities, free wi-fi - friendly staff, even the lobby smells amazing!

...well, this was according to our ‘Harry Potter Trail’ guide, Will. But less about that... I am very happy to say that its reputation is most definitely warranted. What a fabulous ‘little’ hotel! Myself and my partner have always wanted to stay at the Balmoral on our numerous trips to Edinburgh, and finally we made it. We booked a Deluxe Room on the 6th floor (636) overlooking Calton Hill and Arthur’s Seat – it was a lovely room, very spacious indeed. The service throughout our stay was impeccable, from the Reception to the Concierge to the Spa staff. We had some great treatments from the ESPA Spa where the facilities were very good. The concierge also managed to get us into the up and coming chef Michael Naeve’s restaurant at very short notice which turned out to be one of the best meal’s we have ever had. The breakfast was excellent with a buffet as well as cooked to order. We were also given an impromptu tour of the JK Rowling Suite (as above, you can tell we are both big fans..). Unfortunately we were not able to stay there this time (mainly due to its price), but hopefully next time they will treat us to a complimentary upgrade?! All in all, a wonderful stay at The Balmoral. We will most certainly return.	Dear Guest Thank you very much for your fantastic review following your recent stay at The Balmoral. It is most pleasing to learn that your experience lived up to your expectations. Your comments and high rating of the service element of your stay are especially pleasing as we pride ourselves on our warm Scottish hospitality and I am glad that our concierge team were able to assist you with your dinner reservation. We are also delighted to read that you got the opportunity to discover our JK Rowling Suite. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future should you be returning to Edinburgh. Kind Regards Franck X Arnold General Manager +44 (0) 131 556 2414	5	14 December 2015	N/A
	Dear cruisinkim, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your stay with us in October. First of all, please accept my sincere apology for the issues you experienced. I am sorry the room you occupied had deficiencies. We have shared your comments with our Director of Housekeeping to ensure our supervisors report items in the rooms that may not be working properly so we can correct these before a new guest checks in. I am also pleased to say we are in the process of purchasing refrigerators for all the rooms, as well as purchasing new linen, including pillows. Needless to say, I am also sorry the elevators went down during your stay. I know this was an inconvenience to some of our guests and wish that this did not happen. I am not sure where the confusion is regarding our shuttle service. We do operate every day in a 3-mile radius at no charge. We do not offer transportation to the airport, however, there is a local company that does provide service at a nominal charge. I am pleased you enjoyed our new pool bar that overlooks the river, as well as the quality of our food. Our guests have been very complimentary of this new feature, especially with the addition of our fire pit. Once again, we very much appreciate your valuable feedback. I can assure you your stay was the exception, rather than the rule, and hope you will give us another opportunity to better serve you if you return to Tampa again in the future. Best regards, Jeff B, CHA General Manager	2	October 16, 2018	N/A
Tyler was extremely helpful! Told us a great restaurant to go to on the beach that was great. Clean and comfortable room. Conveniently located by the airport and international plaza mall. Very quiet room. All the staff is very friendly. Recommend staying there.	Dear bethwdouglass, Thanks so much for the 5 star review. Tyler is new to our team and has already had a very positive impact on our guests. We really appreciate your kind remarks and I will be sure to pass them on to him. Thanks so much for being our guest! Silvana G.- Guest Service Manager	5	January 14, 2016	N/A
The entrance is not very inviting- a front desk and a huge refrigeration unit filled with drinks for sale. A desk with a computer in the hallway for guests to use. We were asked to sign a paper saying we would be responsible for any damage done to the room which makes me laugh as you will have a hard time finding anything in the room that did not have some damage!!! The furniture needed to be replaced!!!! The whole hotel needed to be redone as for as I am concerned! The hotel layout was poor. We were in the basement in the back of the hotel which was far from front desk. We had trouble closing window that was not completely closed when we arrived. The back entranced needed to be vaccumed badly. They had a great front desk clerk at night !! The ladies at breakfast were great,too!! Even as good as they were, it did not make up for a hotel that needed to be remodeled and work on cleaning issues!!1 We say never again will we stay here!!	"We apologize for not meeting your expectations. We are thankful to be busy and with the high volume of guests, areas can become worn. Our lobby and layout are formats used in many Residence Inn's across the country. Your concerns are of great importance and have been noted, especially the heavy traffic areas, such as entrances. We are always grateful, to be reminded, to look at our surroundings as if we were the guest. At check in, we do ask for every guest to read the policies we have in place and to sign in understanding and/or agreement. The policies include ""Smoke Free"", ""Pet Fee"" and ""rollaway Bed Fee"" and there are associated fees for usage and/or non compliancy. We hope you give us another chance in the future to meet and exceed your needs."	1	June 28, 2012	N/A
Wonderful hotel. Staff are friendly ( husband accidentally dropped a book that went through the two inch gap between the elevator and the floor, and staff retrieved it from its five storey fall). Parking is handy across the street. Been in several hotels this trip in Ireland and the breakfast offered is superior. They do not have a sign, but also make up pancakes to order, and kids really enjoyed that.We had two rooms and they assigned us the rooms at the far end of the hallway, 412 and 413. In the end rooms, it is a large room with extra space and has a full length view of the river , with the groups of swans, and up the far distance and the OTHER set of Windows ( has two because you are at the end of the hallway, )gives a great view of the city. Rooms were very quiet and the bed comfortable . If you do not want to eat dinner at the hotel, there are several restaurants to choose from in easy walking as you stroll down the river board walk.	Dear Lynden C Thank you for the fabulous review. I am glad that you had such an enjoyable stay and we hope to welcome you back to our hotel very soon! Kind regards, Kate Mullaney Front Office Manager	5	28 August 2018	11 September 2018
Just on edge of town, but convenient walking distance to everything. Beautiful room, in immaculate condition. Enjoyed cooking our own dinner for a couple of nights as you can get tired eating out every night. Owners very kind and helpful. Thoroughly recommend.	Hi Annc5 and thanks for posting your review. Yes your right, dinning out every night can become a little tiresome. All of our rooms and apartments have kitchens so if it suits a quick trip to the supermarket and you can cook your own meal and enjoy a relaxing night in or use our BBQ area, great for feeding the family.	5	1 March 2017	14 March 2017
The hotel is very well kept up. The breakfast was very good every morning. The staff was very responsive and helpful. The only issue was with the heating / cooling unit in the room which was quickly resolved by the responsive and efficient desk and maintenance staff.

Originally booked at their other hotel the Maldon Hotel but I had a phone call to stay it wasn’t ready. This hotel was arranged for us immediately which isn’t far from the oringal booking so was absolutely fine by us! When we arrived into our room, shortly after there was a knock at the door with a delivery for me of a box of chocolates and a letter of apology which was really thoughtful! Enjoying our stay so far, being looked after by all the friendly staff which are super down to earth especially the blonde lady at reception, Derek and George in particular :) Lovely hotel and very accommodating!	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We hope to welcome you back to our hotel very soon! Sincerely, Anne O'Leary Deputy General Manager	5	5 July 2018	N/A
Stayed here For the first time due to its close proximity to the Convention centre. The Hilton is so close that if it rains you will not get wet getting there. The rooms are very clean and tidy as you would expect from a Hilton hotel. It is also close to many restaurants and the casino. Excellent place to stay	Many thanks for sharing your feedback on Trip Advisor. I am pleased our location was wonderfully convenient for you and we look forward to welcoming you back to Hilton Melbourne South Wharf when your travels bring you back to the area.

Stayed in Galmont hotel for night with my boyfriend the check in was excellent the woman on the reception was very nice and friendly. The decor of the place was gorgeous. The bedroom was lovely and spacious looking out into water. We had dinner in the restraunt it was amazing tasted so nice and the coctails are excellent and the beer is lovely too. Will definatly be back again a 3rd time	Dear Sarah, Thanks to you and your boyfriend for staying with us and for your kind review. I'm delighted to read that you enjoyed the room and your meal. I do hope that you will both return to stay with us again very soon. Kind regards, Andrew Drysdale General Manager	5	3 May 2018	N/A
	"The so called ""shack"" apartment this guest refers to, is part of the original house which was built in the very early 1900's as was most of the homes in the Manly area - these ""shacks"" are unique to the Manly area and especially Smith Street which has a heritage protection order on these types of dwellings - we do advise guests when booking that this is a very small 1 bedroom apartment - it clearly states that on our website, we work with what we have and there are very few places on the Northern beaches that allow pets - carpets and pets do not go together and for hygiene purposes this apartment is specifically for those owners who travel with their pets. We provide and charge for the parking permits, if we do not do this, then guests would have to move their motor vehicle every 2 hours and that means out of the designated area, alternatively use the council car park which is approximately $100 per day so for $15 per day, we feel we are trying to help our guests. Yes we do have much larger apartments however these may have already been booked by the time this guest booked."	2	10 May 2015	15 May 2015
This was a pleasant place to stay, and the location was ideal if you want to be just outside of the busy areas by minutes. The play area was fun for my almost 2 year old daughter, and the pool looks lovely. This resort is nice and private, has an elevator too. I recommend this place for seniors too.

Front desk was very helpful in the check-in and check-out. Couldn't have asked for anything more. Within walking distance of many attractions. Room was a little crowded. Especially, when the suitcase stand was out in the room.	Glad to hear you enjoyed your stay! We hope to see you again!	5	March 25, 2019	March 26, 2019
I drove up to Columbus last weekend to celebrate Valentine's day with my boyfriend. We got an extremely good rate since I'm a travel agent registered with Marriott hotels. It was super easy to find. When we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the front desk employees who gave us a run-down of the hotel. It was absolutely beautiful. Clearly a new hotel because everything was pristine. When we got up to the room, it was adorable. Nice, modern fixtures, gorgeous bathroom (amazing shower) and a great view of the airport runways to see planes coming in and taking off. We were surprised at how quiet it was for being an airport hotel that close to the planes. The location is great. We were about 5 minutes from Easton and enjoyed our shopping and great food options despite the blizzard we endured! The bar was nice. They had a firepit which we were unable to use due to the amount of snow. Unfortunately, this hotel does not have room-service available but they do have a list of delivery options close by with the phone numbers to make it more convenient. While I slept great, my boyfriend woke up a little bit stiff from the bed. Besides that though, we had an excellent stay and will keep this location in mind for future trips to Columbus! :)	Thank you for spending Valentines Day with us! We're thrilled you enjoyed your experience despite the blustery weather, we are all ready for Spring! Hopefully your next trip will be a little warmer and you can enjoy the outdoor patio and fire-pit. It is one of my favorite features and has been very popular. Thank you for sharing!	5	February 20, 2015	N/A
We have stayed here annually for over a dozen years. it just keep getting better and better. The facility is well maintained and upgraded every year. The entire staff is excellent, friendly an helpful. General Manager Sue Tan is the best Marriott Manager we have ever met. I am a lifetime Marriott Platinum card holder and have met a lot of Marriott GMs over the years and Ms. Tan, from a guest's viewpoint, tops them all! . She runs a great organization, maintains a fantastic facility, has a loyal, well trained, friendly and helpful staff. MCV has become our Nirvana on Earth (or at least in the Far West)	Thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in Phoenix.	5	October 15, 2017	October 16, 2017
Stayed at premises august 26th..cool night..heat wouldnt work..asked front desk to fix..when returned from supper they left a 40 yr old dangerous heater inside door..attendant gone for night..330 awakened by 3 vagrants (dopers)causing disturbance outside our room..they were still hanging around vehicles in parking lot watching me pack at 6 am..realized a mission across street..observed male snorting cocaine beside adjoining business..as retired police officer suggest very dangerous hotel to stay at..black eye on hotels.com association and disgrace to vernon bc..bed uncomfortable..rundown..keep your money and keep driving or pay a little more.. .	"Sorry your so upset. First thing is that our boiler system for our heat has not yet been turned on as it is still warm out, and we do not have 40 year old heaters here as I purchased a bunch of new ones this past winter season. As you were told on check-in, as so is everyone, I do live on-site and if you had any problems then all you had to do was dial ""0"" on your phone in your room and you would have reached me directly and I would have been happy to take care of any issues. If you were awakened at 3:30 by persons you feel are not staying at the motel, then I wish you would have let me know right away or atleast prior to leaving. Our motel is not dangerous to stay at either and I am sorry if you have that opinion. I have been the property manager of the TikiVillage for the past year and have had only three issues on this property and once I had spoken to the people across the street in the park, I havent had any problems except them cutting through the property instead of using the sidewalk.(even with no trespassing signs up), so I have built up a mutal respect. All cities have the less fortunate within and that is one thing I cannot remove from the area. As the Tiki turned 50 this year, it is looking its age but my rooms are clean, most of the beds are comfy, the heated outdoor pool is nice especially after you just had a bbq dinner, the service is fantastic and there is lots of room for the kids to run around. We have plans on rebuilding a new motel over the next couple of years so hope to see you back. Take care."	1	August 27, 2018	N/A
We stayed 2 nights here while visiting for the children’s museum. Staff was excellent, rooms were just fine, breakfast was pretty good, and the pool was well maintained. Worth the money and convenient to I65 and restaurants.	Thank you for taking the time to review Hampton Inn Indianapolis South. We are certainly glad you enjoyed your stay. Thank you for all the wonderful compliments in regards to our hotel. Hopefully the next time you come to Indianapolis you will stop in and stay with us. Have a great day!	4	August 19, 2018	N/A
Friendly staff greeted us for breakfast and the evening reception. Quality food and beverage items are available for guests. Meeting facilities are adequate to the needs of guests. Rooms have sufficient space, and have very comfortable beds. Units are quiet and private. Updating the bathroom area would be a plus for hotel.	Dear Mike C, Thank you for the great review of our hotel. I am glad you had a great stay. We look forward to seeing you again soon.

How often do you get a review written *before* the actual stay itself? I lodged a claim with the Accor price guarantee web site after finding a better price on a non-accor web site. Guess what? Within 1 hour the Accor Guest Relations team emailed me to say they are investigating it. Within 2 hours the GM of the Sebel Busselton called me, and within 3 hours the price match was completed! Bravo! How many global brands can boast blazing fast service like that?	Dear Mr Ian K Your kind words on Tripadvisor before you have even arrived is greatly appreciated. My team and I certainly look forward to welcoming you next month, and I trust you will have a most enjoyable stay here at The Sebel Busselton. We wish you safe travels and look forward to your arrival. Sincerely Michael Eibrink Jansen General Manager The Sebel Busselton	5	15 October 2015	N/A
"Satisfied our needs in fine style. Congenial front desk staff got us checked in quickly and up to our spacious suite. Back down to the lobby for free ""Happy Hour"" of beer and wine with tossed salad, BBQ chicken pizza, potato salad and snacks. Comfortable beds, great breakfast and easy check out. Definitely recommend."	It's always our goal to exceed our guests expectation, What a pleasure it is to hear we did just that, for you! We are so happy you were able to attend one of our Tuesday - Thursday evening social hours. We love this event and chance to get to know our guest. We hope to see you again.

This was my third visit. Not as good as previous visits. 2 menu options from kids menu not available all weekend (it's a small menu) few things missing at breakfast also. Service not as good as before. Not enough staff. Long waits for food. Rooms spotless. Won't be my first choice for future visits. Would expect more for the price.	Dear Guest Many thanks for your review and your feedback regarding the hotel and our team. We are very disappointed to read your comments regarding our service and facilities. We would love the opportunity to speak to you. Please do contact us on 091 521 433 or email our Front Office Manager: cbarnes@theardilaunhotel.ie to discuss your experience in a greater detail.

We stayed in the 3 bedroom penthouse in the first week of April.The owner was very friendly and welcoming and is obviously dedicated to providing accommodation of a high standard. It was absolutely fabulous, very spacious and the views were magnificent. We were lucky to have beautiful weather too! We had the large master bedroom with a large en-suite but the other two bedrooms were also spacious. There was also another toilet/shower room. The kitchen was well equipped and the open plan layout gave it a very spacious feel. Large windows and balcony doors gave plenty of access to those wonderful sea views. Access to the penthouse was up two floors so the owner has installed a lift - there is no problem with carrying heavy bags. We were in close proximity to the shops/restaurants/pubs and used the cliff railway to visit Lynmouth. The main reason for our stay was to continue walking the South West Coast path. I can certainly recommend the sections along this part of the coast. The Valley of the Rocks is amazing and well worth a visit. The walk up to Watersmeet is also worth doing (and you can have a well earned cream tea too!) I would definitely recommend the Penthouse as a place to stay and would certainly stay here again if visiting the area.	Thank you for your comments. We are pleased you enjoyed your stay. Our Penthouse Lynmouth Bay is the pride of our recent renovation, and is proving very popular with our Guests. We look forward to seeing you again. regards Bill	5	21 April 2017	26 April 2017
Nice and fresh camping but they say that they have free WiFi which is not true (according to me at least) since you get 100mb per day which is pretty much nothing. However, only 5$ per day to purchase 10gb for 2 devices.	Thank you for your review, Anna. And, thank you for mentioning the WiFi, as being in a small out of the way town limits our options for internet service. We have managed to up our WiFi offer to 250mg per guest, currently, with fast service. However, I know this is still a long way to go compared to the bigger cities. Safe travels!	3	9 February 2017	N/A
Loved the hotel. Amazed the on line photo looked exactly like our room we booked. Very clean ,new hotel. Room was super cozy with fireplace on private balcony. Fabulous tub included a little ducky.

Grand hall with 2 grand chandelier. Service was not as expected, unfriendly. Since it’s on a perfect location, it gets noisy at night. Walking distance to every destination worth visiting. Close to evey transportartion, if needed.	Dear Guest, Thank you for your feedback. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed our excellent city centre location and our amazing chandeliers!

Lovely hotel, lovely staff, could do better with breakfast, but really lovey coffee. Stayed one night for a concert in the Motorpoint Arena, so a perfect location for that and to do some shopping as well	Dear 883anita, Thank you for your review and for taking the time to provide this feedback. We very much appreciate your comments and are pleased to read that you had such an enjoyable stay with us. We hope that you are going to return in the future for another shopping trip :) Kindest Regards Clare Thomas Front Office Manager	4	22 November 2018	N/A
Hotel lives up to Hyatt standards, very clean with professional staff. Breakfast was good. The lady cooking eggs, sausage, and pancakes was particularly pleasant. Seattle Best coffee was served. There were only two maintenance items in the room: the entire faucet for the main sink in was loose and out of alignment and the mattress could have been turned over since there was a dip in it. I arrived late in the evening and frankly, the parking lot could be a little brighter. Overall I would happily stay again and would recommend this hotel.	Thank you for your feedback. We are happy to hear that overall you have enjoyed your stay with us. I have looked into the issues you experienced within your room, and we are taking action to fix them. We hope to see you again in the future.	4	September 10, 2016	N/A
The hotel was great. Nothing fancy but clean and easy to get town. Easy check in and complementary parking out front. Didn't explore the bar and restaurant attach. Ennis is a small town and we had a great one night stay there.	Dear Guest, Thank you for staying with us recently and also for taking the time to share your feedback. I am delighted to read that you enjoyed your whole experience including the complimentary guest car parking. Ennis is a beautiful town to wander around and our central location lends to a relaxing stress free break. Looking forward to welcoming you back to Temple Gate Hotel in the future. Kind regards, Marie Faughnan Operations Manager	5	6 January 2020	N/A
I stayed at this hotel back in late September and this hotel was very nice, clean with a modern look. Check-in was quick & easy; the staff was very helpful when asking about shopping, attractions etc. The location was excellent where I would only need to walk a few blocks to get to the boardwalk and view from my hotel room looked onto signal hill, which was a nice sight to wake up to. I often stay at Cambridge Suites in Toronto on business, therefore I assumed it would be the same “Suite-like” feel; however the room was quite a bit smaller and also didn't have a separate living area as do the rooms in Toronto, non-the-less I was still pleased with the accommodations. The rooms were a little noisy; I could hear conversations of the people staying in the room next to me; again this is not a reflection on the hotel, simply the guests next door. There is a gym and Jacuzzi on one of the higher levels and has everything one would need for a quick workout. Overall the hotel is nice and the location is great. I would recommend staying here and if I am ever out that way again, I would stay here. Thx!	Dear Jeff C, Thank you so much for the great review! I am happy to hear you enjoyed our facilities and we look forward to hosting you again soon. Kind Regards, Megan	4	January 10, 2014	N/A
We only stayed here one night so I can't give it a truly comprehensive review. The room was nice, clean and had everything you would need. The service was great, I had accidentally booked a twin room instead of a double and they changed it immediately with no fuss. We didn't eat in the restaurant but the food sounds lovely so we might be back for that. I would stay again.	Dear wendy s, Thank you for letting us know about your experience. We are always happy to make amendments to bookings, availability permitting, and I am pleased we were able to help you on this occasion. Looking forward to seeing you again soon.	4	7 October 2015	N/A

I was searching for a better motel/hotel to stay at for an upcoming cruise. The last one we stayed at charged more, charge for a 3rd person taking a shuttle and charged us all to take the shuttle back. This hotel allowed us to park free up to 14 days and didn't charge for any of us to take the shuttle to and from the cruise port. We arrived about an hour before check-in but were given a room that was ready at that time. The room was nice and cool. It was located on the side by the highway but we didn't hear any noise. The swimming pool was heated and awesome! Everyone was so friendly. We were taken to the cruise port and dropped off at the time we requested and were promptly picked up after a quick call to the hotel to let them know we were back. We arrived back to the hotel around 09:45 am and were really tired. We asked what the possibility was that we could spend the night again and were told that was not a problem. The desk clerk told us to sit down and eat some breakfast and they would get a room cleaned for us. We were in the room by 10:30 a.m. We will definitely stay at this hotel again when we are in the area!	Dear Travelinggrandma001, Thank you for the positive comments you shared about your recent stay. I am pleased to know that you were satisfied with your accommodations and were able to take advantage of our Stay, Park & Cruise Package. I hope that when planning your trips to Tampa you make the Quality Inn & Suites Near Fairgrounds/Ybor City your home away from home! We look forward to seeing you again.

Excellent location as only a few minutes walk into city centre, Nice friendly staff and always helpful and knowledgeable about what’s around if your not sure. Secure parking across the road, Room was spotless and always tended to as required, couldn’t ask for anything more from the always polite staff.	Dear 1Mcg7, Thank you firstly for choosing our hotel and for sharing your experience with us on tripadvisor.

	Thank you for your review of your stay with us while traveling to Denver. I am so sorry that you experienced the issues above, we did not meet your expectations nor did we meet our own. I can assure you we will be following up with both the front desk and the housekeeping departments so they understand the importance of following through on details and coaching them on other parking options that are around the hotel if you did not want to park with us. This review was very hard for me to read as all of our management team holds our employees to such high standards and this is very out of the ordinary for our team as you can see from the previous reviews of the hotel but this is being taken very seriously. Hope you had safe travels home from your trip and hope you have a wonderful rest of your summer.	1	June 7, 2019	June 12, 2019
Great location with a flair of old grandeur. The stunning old building is part of the central station. Very big, nice rooms that give you a sense of the history of this place. Friendly staff, good breakfast (very good haggis!). It can get quite busy and a bit loud around the hotel, especially in the evening. So keep that in mind if you have a very light sleep. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would recommend it to everyone who likes hotels with a bit of history.	Dear sbe_000 Thank you for the Kind review. I am glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. Kind regards, Graeme	4	30 August 2016	9 September 2016
My partner and I went for my birthday and we did have a nice room and the restaurant was good! Our room had a coffee machine in the and a dressing and slippers were provided. The pool and the steam room were included in the stay and we did enjoy that but the worst thing about the hotel was the cost of the car park. We had to pay £12 for parking and I thought it was absolutely crazy, if it wasn't for that I would of rated the hotel a 4 star! Make sure you get your car parking ticket validated on arrival otherwise you will get charged £24.	Thank you very much for your review - we really value your feedback. I look forward to welcoming you back soon. Kind regards, Douglas Goncalves	3	7 August 2017	15 August 2017
Amazing Sunday brunch ! Quality of of the choices on the menu excellent.

Good and convenient cheaper if you pre-pay. I'm not sure but I think your room will be according to what you pay. I paid less for prepay so I think my upgrade was not available, imagine that!

Booked a cheap deal for a couple of nights and was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Opened our door to find we had a room with a sea view and a lovely bay window with a very comfortable seat and table. The room was spotlessly clean and had quality biscuits and tea/coffee facilities. All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly. The hotel itself, though old, does not show its age. There is a large restaurant which we didn't use, and a bar where bar meals are served at very reasonable prices. There really is no need to go into town to eat. Free WiFi is included. There is a gym and indoor pool for guests to use, but we didn't use these facilities during our stay. We will definitely stay here again when visiting Newquay as we really can't think how you could want better at this price.	Thank you for your review. Its pleasing to read you enjoyed your Sea View Room. Our staff aim to be friendly and attentive so it’s wonderful to read your positive review relating to our staff. Unfortunately, we do not have a gym, but we do have sauna facilities and an indoor pool. We have a varied selection of options for Dining. Our Daily Bar Specials are always reasonably priced. We look forward to your return.	5	23 February 2018	24 February 2018
Great location. Loved the valet parking. Was able to prolong parking by paying nominal fee allowing us to view colleges in Boston without worrying about the car.

We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights from 5th till 9th Dec 2019. On arrival we were given the option of 7th or 17th floor. We opted for the 7th as there is a nightclub on the 18th so thought this may be noisy.the view from our room was amazing. The hotel was clean and staff were very friendly,.polite and keen to help. The bar on 18th floor is great and great views of the New York skyline. The subway is approx 5-10min walk away and takes u all over Manhatten. The area of the Hotel also has great bars/resteraunts in its vcinity and is a bit quieter than midtown areas, which was nice to escape the business of times square etc. Would defo stay here again.

Just opened in August 2018. Lovely setting and great accommodations. Continental breakfast typical but it was free so no complaints. The morning shift desk help lacked personality but we didn’t let her rain on our day. She also didn’t seem to be familiar with the Hyatt Passport member benefits.	Jbhowser, Thank you for your review of your stay with us. We are happy to learn that you enjoyed your time in Moab and the accommodations. I am very sorry that our Gallery Host was not more attentive during your visit. We pride ourselves on caring for our guests and this issue will be addressed for further improvement. Some of the confusion could be because the loyalty program is no longer called Hyatt Passport and since we have been open, the new program is referred to as World of Hyatt. We will be sure to use this as a training opportunity. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of your vacation, we hope to see you on your next trip to Moab.

I have really good things to say but One bad thing: the BAD first: what happened? We've been coming here for the past 5 years and never had this problem. There were almost no utensils in our 2 bedroom suite. We had to buy bowls, plates and cutlery because the room was stocked really poorly! Just 2 wine glasses, 4 plates.. etc. we had people over and had to buy our own cutlery glasses etc. The GOOD Awesome, maybe the best location Nice indoor pool, hot tub and gym Too bad they lost their sand beach, they still have about 5 metres of grass but the sandy part has been flooded so if you have kids you need to anter down the beach a bit and use someone elses beach ALSO Thanks to the older fellow at reception desk. On the night of June 28/june 29 My son was sick and crying all night long ; finally at 3 AM I came down to reception asking for help We had a 2 BR suite and no one could sleep. The nice gentleman gave us a secluded 2 BR suite for the rest of the night for free, talking about good customer service!	Dear Guest We would like to thank you for choosing Holiday Inn & Suites Osoyoos for recent stay. We are glad to know that you have enjoyed your recent stay with us and we truly appreciate your recognition about resort facility and services.

"The overall hotel is great but the ""room service"" and ""breakfast buffet"" was disappointing. The molten cake isn't actually molten cake and is a dry chocolate cake with sauce spread over it..... The breakfast buffet as standard but NO filtered coffee as they only have a ""coffee machine"" and we all know EVERYONE loves a good coffee in the morning :)"	Hi Wayne Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Mayfair and for your review. I'm pleased that you found the hotel great overall, but sorry that in-room dining and breakfast did not meet with your expectations. This is unusual and I'll review with the team. I can confirm Barista coffee is certainly available at breakfast. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future.

Great hotel. Our room was lovely with probably the comfiest bed we had in N.Z. Dinner and breakfast were both delicious. We only had one night here but managed to go to the wildlife park opposite to see kiwis in the nocturnal house and after our lovely dinner strolled to the Glacier Thermal Pools for an hour or two to finish off the evening. We were lucky the weather allowed us to take the helicopter ride to the glaciers the next morning. As part of a tour group we couldn't stay here longer on this trip but if you have flexibility, stay a bit longer as you may need to wait for the right weather for the helicopter flights.	Dear Bev and Phil M, Thank you for your positive feedback. It was good to see that you made the most of your time in Franz Josef Glacier and explored a number of activities we have on offer. The Glacier Hot Pool and the Wildlife Centre are definitely worth a visit and some of the highlight attractions we like to recommend to our guests as they. Thank you for staying at the Scenic Hotel Franz Josef Glacier and we hope that you visit again. Best regards, Alexander	4	20 June 2014	23 June 2014
Stayed at the Novotel on Saturday, the hotel was beautifully appointed and peaceful, and the staff were beyond helpful. Would recommend to everyone I have recommended the hotel to everyone I’ve met lol it was so great. Truly a slice of heaven	Kia ora Kerry, We're so delighted to have had you with us. It's wonderful to know that you loved the peace and quiet of Our Place and I'm chuffed to read that the team looked after you really well! Your welcome at our little heaven on earth anytime.

The Rose Hotel is a lovely luxurious hotel with friendly courteous staff, excellent free parking. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. Would highly recommend and hope to visit again when the opportunity arises.	Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely review. It brings us great pleasure to know that you enjoyed your stay. I will certainly pass on your compliments to the team. We hope to welcome you back again in the future. Best wishes, Mark Sullivan General Manager	5	3 February 2019	4 February 2019
Excellent location. Very friendly staff. Top breakfast. Lift is a little slow but easy access to all floors. Great views of Brighton seafront. Use the local car park as it is cheaper than the hotel itself.	Good afternoon and thank you for your kind review. Happy to read you have enjoyed your time at the hotel and in Brighton. We hope to welcome you back in the near future, please contact us directly for the best offers. Many thanks, Stephen Hogg Senior Receptionist	5	1 July 2017	N/A
The food served by Demetrius for breakfast buffet is excellent. He is worth the stay. Their is always salmon in the morning with all the tasteful trimmings. Mulu the buffet waitress is kind and extremely helpful.	Dear 945lawrencem, Thank you very much for recently staying with us here at the DoubleTree. I will be sure to pass on your compliments to Demetrius and Mulu in the breakfast area for the great work they are doing. Please keep us in mind the next time you are passing through the Denver area. Sincerely, Matthew Anderson Hotel Manager (303) 262-7701	5	January 28, 2017	January 31, 2017
We recently stayed here for 3 days. The first impression ( at least for people from US) was that the rooms look small compared to similar hotels in the US. But at the end of the 3 days we found that it was more comfortable than expected. The rooms have more features, the staffs were very friendly and the breakfast had good variety of food. We didn't have to use the power adapter as the room already had a in-built US plug. Every day they provided complimentary water bottles and candy/fruits. It is surrounded with a lot of good restaurants. We had booked a HOHO bus tour and the pick up spot was only half a mile away. So it became an easy walk. The train station was also a minute walk only.	Dear GopRam, Thank you for writing a review of the Park Grand Kensington. I am thrilled that you loved our facilities and took advantage of our location. I am delighted that you loved our courteous and service oriented staff. We wait to have the pleasure welcoming you back again in the future. Kind regards, Arpan Ghosh	5	1 January 2020	N/A

We were only in Shannon for two nights but this was perfect! The service was friendly, the rooms well appointed and comfortable, and the breakfast was delicious. It appears to have been recently redone and we really enjoyed our stay.	Dear Barkley S, Thank you for taking the time to post a 5* review of your stay at Treacys Oakwood Hotel, Shannon. We are delighted that your enjoyed your stay and that you found our staff members friendly. As the Hotel is coming to the end of a refurbishment we are happy to read that you liked the new decor in the Hotel. All of our beds are super comfy King Koil bed ensuring a great nights sleep! We look forward to welcoming you back to the Hotel in the future. We really appreciate your review.	5	26 April 2019	N/A
I was so impressed by the authenticity and integrity of the staff, especially in the restaurant (breakfasts are divine) and house keeping (Name begins with N) was super. Everyone was so helpful and interested in my well-being and comfort.	Aloha Sarah H, Happy Holidays and thank you for staying at Airport Honolulu Hotel! We are appreciative that you took the time to write a review and acknowledge our staff. In the review prior a guest advised our staff was rude. Our staff goes above and beyond to assist our guests and so thank you for sharing your encounters with other potential guests. Again, thank you for staying with us and hope you have a Happy New Year!

On a golfing trip , we spent our last 3 nights at vthis place. It is all apartment accommodation with no eating facilities. Looked like heaps around it but nothing, almost, was open despite it being a holiday week in October. Definitely not suitable for our group and not terribly appealing in any case. Needs serious renovation but until surrounding facilities are open definitely unsuiatble for peole with heir own vehicle and perhaps a family to dump by the pool - whic hwas too small anyway.	Hi Horgan1510, I’m disappointed to read you didn’t enjoy your stay at Seashells Mandurah. We pride ourselves at providing the very best self-contained apartments with a full kitchen and laundry facilities so people can live on-site and cook for themselves, never having to stray too far from our beautiful apartments, infinity pool, BBQ area and Comet Bay Beach. There are a number of shops, café’s and restaurants less than 5 minutes walk from our front door offering some of the best food and views in Mandurah including Catch 22, Seafood Nation, Moka Café and more. I’d also say we were totally suitable for people with, and without, their own vehicles and yes, families do love our swimming pool and beachfront access. Best wishes for your future travels.	3	26 October 2019	4 December 2019
Our youth sports team was one of many that booked a weekend stay at this hotel, and from the moment we entered we were treated like we were their most important guests. Roxanne was a delight at check-in, and JT was also very friendly and helpful. Roxanne somehow remembered my name and addressed me by name every time I passed the front desk over the weekend. She was funny and professional at the same time. Our group spent a lot of down time in the lobby area, and we were never made to feel unwelcome or inconvenient. When we were in our rooms, we found that everything worked well and the beds were comfortable. I liked the fact that the bathroom had a walk-in shower. The breakfast buffet was not very good and was terribly understaffed. One member of our group ordered off the menu, but it appeared to be the same food as the buffet. The guy who was working the dining room was trying his best, but it was not possible for him to help a large number of customers by himself. That was really the only downside to our stay. In the evening, the bartender was very helpful and entertaining. Every staff member was terrific. I would be very happy to stay again.	We are glad that you enjoyed your stay and found your room comfortable. Thanks for the shout out our staff, especially JT and Roxanne. Our staff takes a lot of pride in their work and we appreciate you recognizing them. Also, thanks for letting us know about the opportunities for improvement at breakfast. We appreciate the feedback and will look into it! We very much look forward to seeing you again.	4	January 13, 2016	N/A
I was looking for a place with basic food and it looked like a good option. They were kind. The food was good. Not cheap though. Tables are not comfortable for lunch and more appropriate for tea time.	Dear, Thank you for choosing RIU Hotels and Resorts for your vacation and for sharing your experience with us. As a service-oriented hotel chain, we really appreciate your positive comments about our staff and we are glad to hear that we were able to meet your taste with our gastronomy.

Service of the hotel staff was A1, always there to help and advise. The concierge were fantastic, helpful and the front reception staff were always there with a smile on their faces. Rooms were very clean and the position of the hotel is great. It's right on the darling harbour, close to cafes, great scenery, and close to the city & short walk to Chinatown.	Dear 627mrk, Thank you for sharing your review and great to see that you found our location to be perfect for what you wanted to do whilst in Sydney. I was particularly pleased to see that the service provided to you by our staff was of a high standard and they assisted you with all of the information that you needed. We look forward to seeing you again on your next visit. Andrew Allen Hotel Manager	5	21 May 2018	N/A
Directly opposite the tube station, centrally based in a quiet area. The service was absolutely first class we found. From the chaps greeting us outside, to reception, to room service and within the resturant. My partner and I stayed here for my birthday celebrations and had a wonderful time. Thank you Conrad St James. We would certainly recommend your hotel and fabulous staff	Thank you for your fantastic feedback. I was overjoyed to read such wonderful praise. Thank you for choosing Conrad London St James your hotel of choice to celebrate your birthday. We pride ourselves on our first class service and I am happy that you had a wonderful time. I do so hope you will spend upcoming celebrations with us where we will continue to deliver a truly inspiring stay.	5	9 February 2016	N/A
	"Thank you for taking the time to post your lovely review on TripAdvisor following your recent visit. You are absolutely correct that Brighton is buzzing buzzing throughout the Summer. Perhaps you should think about returning then to experience it first hand ? Thank you for the great tip about parking too. JUSTPARK can be a really helpful site. Another option for parking is to look at the ""contact"" page on our own website which has some really helpful information regarding parking around Brighton."	4	17 February 2016	18 February 2016
This is a nice hotel about 40 minutes walk (or 10 minutes on a bus which runs every 5-10 minutes) from Oxford city centre. Iffley village is lovely, with a good pub close by (the Prince of Wales). The staff were lovely and helpful. The breakfast, while busy (and perhaps, as a result) a little chaotic, was good; though the buffet part was a bit dull and didn't seem to get replenished. The only issue was the room we were given. It was a bit small, but the main issue was the HIDEOUS decor. Purple walls with one covered in the most atrocious wallpaper of purple flowers and butterflies. Frankly, when we walked into the room, we both burst out laughing! They'd also hung a huge TV on the wall: so big that it was disconcerting and so close to the bed that the poor quality of the screen was completely obvious. They really need to redecorate the room a little more neutrally.	Thank you for your comments. We are pleased to read that although you didn't like your bedroom, you found the staff to be helpful and thought breakfast was good. We do have a number of requests for this bedroom but understand if it is not to your taste, I would urge anyone that isn't happy with their bedroom to contact the hotel reception. We hope to welcome you back to Hawkwell House Hotel soon.	4	17 November 2013	N/A
HGI Airport is a great place to stay prior to leaving or arriving at PHX Sky Harbor. It is quiet which is important when traveling.

"Had a great time at surf camp australia! Now i want to specify that the most fundemental thing at surfcamp is that you put some effort and appricitation into surfing. It is a surfing camp, not a drinking camp. The days at surfcamp will leave you happily exhausted, ripping waves with extremly positive and funny instructors! You will be laughing all day, and in the evenings you will be dripping saltwater out of ur ears and nose. The accomodation is great and the vibe is chilled. special shoutout to the kitchen staff, masterchefs; Calum, Yuma and Jordan! they will be coocking up some killer meals including"" not giving any spoilers here"",but it rimes with mangaroo chew ;). Damn they even have options for picky vegans :o. the evenings are for chilling, go down to the beach and grab a few beers as your listening to the waves and watching the stars with ur mates. But remember always be rested and give maximum effort when ur surfing, which is what its all about. i will not say too much about the surf either then that it would get u hooked, welcome a new lifestyle!"	HI William, Thank you for taking the time to write us a review! Stoked to read that you enjoyed your time with us down at surf camp! It's always great to see another past surf camper hooked on surfing as a result of our lessons, we aim to provide all our guests with the knowledge needed to be able to surf by themselves post camp and I hope you are still doing so! Thanks, and hope you keep surfing!	5	18 March 2017	N/A
a beautiful hotel in a great location in Nashville within walking distance to music venues and restaurants. Lobby had lots of seating options, room was large and had plenty of drawer and closet space, staff was very friendly and accommodating, food services were above average for a hotel.

Thank you so much Vanessa and Bookie, we had a wonderful time staying in your beautiful cottages. Our first visit last year in December made us realize we want to come back as it is the perfect place to unwind, to relax in peace and comfort. With attention to detail in the cottages and the gardens you created a wonderful place. Thank you also for arranging the airfares and car hire, everything worked out perfect. Your place and the whole island is a real gem. Keep it like that. We wish you all the best and look forward to come back again one day ... Eva & Robert	Lovely to have you both back again and to catch up over coffee....thanks so much for choosing to stay with us again! Glad you had a great stay and we'll be in touch!

Excellent location, in the middle of everything so within walking distance of landmarks and museums. Friendly and helpful staff who helped us with tours and finding our way around. Large and clean modern rooms. Convenient parking in building for reasonable fee.	Thank you for taking the time to share your stay experience with us here in Charlotte. We are pleased to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed our city, the people and our amenities here at the hotel. We look forward to seeing you again soon!	5	June 20, 2017	N/A
We were picked up relatively quickly at the airport (we had to wait for the van to come back because it was full). Upon arrival we were greeted at the front desk with bottles of cold water and offers of dental and shaving gear if needed. The restaurant/bar was still open and the service was friendly and quick. The room was spacious and clean. There was some jet noise but that is to be expected when you are near the airport. The breakfast was included in our weekend stay and was plentiful with a much wider variety of choices than at many other places I've stayed and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The shuttle to the airport was on time and efficient. I would definitely stay here again if I am on a layover.	Good afternoon John, We are extremely pleased that you enjoyed staying with us and that we exceeded your expectations! We look forward to seeing you again in the future and appreciate you choosing our hotel very much. On behalf of our entire team, we wish you safe travels and that you for your loyalty to our hotel and the Hilton Brand. Safe Travels!!	5	October 8, 2018	October 9, 2018

I've stayed at this Westin a couple of times and think it's the best downtown location. The rooms give a great view of the city and the pool is uniquely found on the 4th floor. The hotel is connected by a skyway to shops and businesses. But the best is it's right on the 16th Street Mall, which is a unique place to walk and people watch. The hotel room was clean and Westin has the best bedding for a comfortable sleep.	Dear cws_design, I truly thank you for the gift of feedback and your encouraging words. We are quite proud of our hotel and agree with you we have the best location of any downtown hotel in Denver. Thank you also for your loyalty to Westin and our Heavenly Bed and am very glad you had a great night here.

I have stayed here about 4, 5 times as when I go out in Cardiff I like to stay in town rather than get a taxi home and I always chose this hotel. Myself and my friend love this hotel as the staff are always really welcoming and courteous, the rooms are immaculate (never had any problems) and the beds are really comfy. The location is superb as it is right opposite John Lewis and about 2 minute walk to the night-life. Stayed here last night and again we had a fantastic stay and enjoyed the buffet breakfast this morning. We have stayed in the Junior Suite back in Dec 2011 which for a special occasion is worth the upgrade as the room is much bigger and there is a separate living room area. I will definitely be staying here again and again and again...	Hello there and thank you so much for such a lovely review, I was delighted that you scored us 5/5 and I'm really pleased that you have chosen to stay with us time after time. Thank you so much for the lovely comments too about our staff and the cleanliness of the rooms, I'll make sure everyone hears about your feedback. I'm so glad you enjoyed staying in one of our suites on your previous visit and that you enjoyed the extra room and facilities. I look forward to welcoming you when you next stay with us, thank you once again. Kind regards Sally	5	10 March 2012	12 March 2012
My wife and I have stayed at many hotels/resorts in our lifetime and when it comes to Rehoboth Beach the Bellmoor never disappoints. Clean, Courteous and Charming describe the staff and premises.

This place is beautifully furnished and although the rooms are small they are immaculate Staff are friendly and helpful There are couple of nightly things that need to be sorted The carpets in the corridor are threadbare. Bit a good impression when you’re going to your room. Air conditioning I was on fourth floor and very hot so had to open window which was noisy didn’t lead to a good nights sleep The bed and linen was immaculate but the pillows were shocking like laying on bricks I wouldn’t come back without AC and better pillows Shame as I’m up here monthly	Thank you for your kind feedback, we are delighted you liked our rooms and will pass your lovely comments on to our staff. We are sorry you were not completely satisfied with your room, we do have alternative pillows at reception that you can request. We do not have air conditioning in our rooms but we will definitely keep your feedback in mind and alternatively we also have fans behind the desk at reception we can offer our guests on request. We would love to have you back and hope to welcome you again soon.	3	31 May 2018	N/A
Stayed at this hotel on a break to Sydney. Can't fault it at all. Staff friendly and helpful and location is perfect. Right on on the darling harbour which is superb. Lovely bar area and great breakfast. The room we had was quite small for a family of four but it didn't effect our stay as we were out and about sightseeing all the time and not spending time in the room unless to sleep. All in all a very pleasant stay.	Dear Kelly W, Thank you for choosing to stay at Novotel Sydney Darling Harbour and taking the time to provide us with feedback. We do hope you enjoyed your stay and we hope your next visit will be another memorable stay. Kind Regards, Richard Holt General Manager	4	24 September 2017	N/A
Stayed there at the start of summer Thought it was really quite bad. Room had been painted,the smell of it was very pungent! Large stains all over the carpet.. food was below par.. having to pay for parking..overall an unpleasant experience.. wouldn't recommend and will not be back..	Dear CorW5, we accept all reviews both positive and negative as customer feedback is a vital part of achieving good customer service. As you would have noticed the Hotel is been refurbished, so apologies for the smell of paint. We are a City Centre Hotel so Car Parking charges are a fairly normal practice and we do provide a discount which entitles 24 hour secure parking for £7.50.

We were here 3 nights for the International Conference of Police Chaplains Region 7 training seminar. It was a nice place for a conference. The breakfast staff had to work hard to keep enough food and coffee out for everyone, but they did a great job. Ice cream and cobbler were provided every evening from 9-11, this was a real treat. The rooms were nice.	Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for reviewing Camden Hotel! We appreciate your business and are so happy that you were able to come stay at our hotel for a conference. We appreciate you mentioning our hard working staff. They do their best to keep up with the demands of our complimentary breakfast. There are times that a rush of people come at once and that makes it tricky but they want to make sure that our guests enjoy the variety that we offer. It sounds like the room met your expectations and overall you had a great stay. We are happy that we were a part of it! We hope that you will choose to stay with us again in the future! Please tell your friends and family about our lovely hotel as well! Sincerely, Camden Hotel Management	4	April 25, 2015	N/A
"(on behalf of my parents) This place relies on captured , assumed business....that is , provides a clean bed and minimal amenities for the cost. It's #1 because there is nothing better- unfortunately. Everything about the room screamed ""cheap fix"". Absolute least money spent on perishables (biscuits, tea coffee etc). Consider only off peak season. Perhaps decrease the price or increase value ?"	Dear Ben W, Thank you for taking the time to share with me the recent experience of your parent’s stay at The Sebel Harbourside Kiama. I was most concerned to read your comments and I sincerely apologise that they were not satisfied with the level of accommodation provided during their stay. Please rest assured that I will address the issues you have raised and treat the feedback as constructive criticism as intended. Once again thank you for your patronage and this valuable feedback. Kind regards, Craig Hardy Acting General Manager	3	1 June 2015	N/A
My husband and I spent one night here before leaving for Uluru, and that was enough. It is like a dated 1980s motel. The room was spacious enough but the bed was lumpy, the duvet was stained, and the bathroom needed completely gutting and refitting. The metal staircases between the levels meant that anyone moving around made a lot of noise. The restaurant served a mediocre dinner (although we found a much better place in town), and the breakfast was extremely poor. Fruit, 3 choices of cereal and bread (that hadn't been refilled), and only honey or peanut butter for your toast. The gentleman serving looked extremely unhappy in his job. We had a piece of toast and decided not to risk anything else. Passable for a one night stop over but would not recommend.	Dear Thomas G, Thank you for your review on TripAdvisor regarding your stay. I'm sorry that the hotel did not meet your expectations during your stay. We are currently in the process of revamping our Breakfast selection and are continuously having improvements made to the property - please rest assured, the issues that you mentioned will also be investigated and addressed. I hope you can one day return to the property - please contact me directly should you choose to stay again and I will ensure you a pleasant stay. Sincerely, Liz Hunter General Manager	1	1 September 2015	9 December 2015

We had a great trip. Beautiful 2 bedroom 2 bathroom townhouse with everything we needed to prepare meals and sit by the fire place. We enjoyed the private hot tub. The location was great to make day trips to local beaches or casual shopping in the heart of Tofino.	Thank you, I am pleased that you enjoyed your cottage. Yesterday we ordered brand new, state of the art, hot tubs. Really nice and very energy efficient. You will just have to return! Tim Hackett	5	January 26, 2016	January 30, 2016
The Oak M is at the very end of Palmer street. Dont be put off by location, its an easy walk of this long street to any one of the many cafes, restaurants and bars that inhabit the street. I was on the 6th floor and in a large studio apartment. Everything was as it looked in the photos. There was a full sized fridge and suitable utensils and pots etc for cooking if needed....I opted for the restaurants on the street...alot easier for me. The bed was slightly hard for my taste and my only other complaint was the tiny pool hidden away in a shady spot. But other than that the staff were friendly, rooms were serviced every day, and the facilities were fresh and modern.	Thank you for the review. It is great to see that we had met your expectations. M on Palmer is on a great location as you described and the heritage listed on site restaurant has the convenience of chargeback and also take away for an even easier option. We also do offer free BBQ facilities by the pool which is a great place to relax on those hot summer days. Look forward to seeing you again soon.	4	15 October 2014	N/A
Our experience was simply tremendous. Really love the gym, pool and the breakfast with the VEGETABLE MEDLEY was superb. The leadership was very attentive to detail and everyone made us feel WELCOME from CHECK-IN to departure. A+ customer service.

Keep up the great work and may YAHUAH bless you ALL. :)	Thank you for taking the time out to review our hotel as well as your stay.

People are very friendly at the reception especially. They were helpful, patience and understanding. The rooms are so nice and the location was great. It is close enough to the downtown of Tampa and there was a new hang-out area within walking distance with different types of restaurants and bars. The 24-hour gym is small but it has enough to do some workout after all big meals. The breakfast menu was not much of a choice though. Sometimes they will have wine tasting at the reception since Bern's has a wine shop in the hotel. Bern's is considered to be one of the best steak house in Tampa with a huge wine cellar in the restaurant which is right across from the hotel.	Hello there Anna, Thank you so much for staying with us and for taking a moment to share your story with the TripAdvisor community. We loved having you and were pleased to hear you enjoyed your experience. Thank you for the kind words around our rooms, location and proximity to Bern's Steak House. We are privileged to be able to tell their story! Please note that we have a number of changes coming to our food and beverage menu in the next few months so we hope to welcome you back to experience the enhanced options. Again, thank you for staying and hope you have a wonderful Memorial Day weekend. Kind regards, Kevin Scott kscott@epicureanhotel.com	4	May 23, 2018	N/A
We spent one night here as we went up Mt. Revelstoke and then to the Giant Cedars Boardwalk. Easy parking in front of your room (1st floor) and the standard Days Inn continental breakfast the next day. Be aware there is no elevator to 2nd floor, so if you have lots of luggage or can't climb stairs well, request ground floor.	Thank you for your review! We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay and we hope to welcome you back again in the future!	4	July 21, 2019	July 25, 2019
Good location (close to the beach and not too far away from the center, very friendly and helpful owners and staff, great breakfast, a squeaky clean bedroom and bathroom. Excellent directions to local top quality restaurants.	Dear BKrul2001 Thank for taking the time in your very busy schedule to share your experiences with other travellers visiting Albany into the future. It is indeed a great compliment to receive such lovely feedback - especially from someone who travels so far and wide. We hope your travels may bring you back to Western Australia again some time into the future - we would love to show you more of what Albany has to offer! Warm regards Sally & Craig	5	6 March 2013	N/A
The staff were courteous and knowledgable, the bed comfortable and the breakfast hardy enough. It's a great place to stay if you're doing business downtown in Sudbury. There are also a few good restaurants and a small park near by so the overall experience is pleasant.	Thank you kindly for the lovely review you provided us with. We are very happy to see that you enjoyed your experience at our hotel and we look forward to hosting you once again when your travels bring you to Sudbury. Thank you again for taking the time out of your busy schedule to share your thoughts with us.	5	July 30, 2015	July 31, 2015
We stayed here back in 2014 for a week. No complaints regarding the hotel and the view is amazing, with pods of dolphins swimming right up to the shore in front of the balconies. If you are coming here without a car for your stay be prepared to walk 10 to the nearest bus stop and 20 mins to the train station. We found it quite isolated in regards to finding somewhere to eat at night as we didn't bother with car hire. All in all though it's a lovely hotel in a very picturesque area.	Dear sooozi76, Thank you for sharing your review of Pier 21 with the online community. The Swan River views are quite unforgettable and the dolphins do add an extra special touch! Since your stay in 2014 we have seen a growing number of fabulous boutiques and eateries opening in the North Fremantle area, all within a short walking distance to the hotel. I do hope we will have the pleasure of welcoming you back to the hotel in the near future and we thank you again for taking the time to share your Pier 21 experience. Best regards, Tim Newson General Manager	4	4 April 2016	N/A
This was our first visit to a Trump Hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed it! The staff is very friendly and professional at all times. The front desk staff were welcoming and pleasant, and greeted us with smiles. First impressions are important and the front desk staff set the tone for a wonderful stay. The hotel room was clean and beautiful with much attention to detail and included pillow options, bathrobes and slippers, Nespresso coffee machines, extra large TV and a TV in the bathroom. The bathroom is gorgeous with tile interior and modern fixtures. An electric switch operates the curtains to the room. Our room had a gorgeous view of the city! There are at least two outlets to charge phones and devises on the night stand for convenience which is so helpful. Shops and restaurants are within walking distance from the hotel. Although $$$$, this hotel is worth it. The rooftop terrace and Rebar are amazing spots for cocktails and views of Chicago. Tip: Take the river boat tour offered by the Chicago Architectural Foundation, on the First Lady. The departure point is a short, five-minute stroll from the hotel, and you can get your tickets at the booths there.	Dear Guest, I am very pleased to read you enjoyed your first visit to Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago. Thank you for taking the time to share your kind recognition of our Front Desk team as they strive to ensure your stay is comfortable and warmly memorable. I also appreciate you sharing in your review the amenities that you most enjoyed during your visit and I hope you will allow us the opportunity to welcome you back in the near future. I certainly look forward to welcoming your return. Sincerely, Colm O'Callaghan Regional Vice President	4	August 8, 2015	N/A
I had the pleasure of staying at Trinity Wharf for the NGINZ Conference in June 2014. The rooms are great but what really sets this place apart is the exceptional service and amazing food. I had the basic room and it was spacious, comfortable and relaxing. The free in-room WiFi made working and keeping in touch with family so much easier. A large part of the success of the conference is down to the venue. As part of the conference organising committee this is one aspect we cannot control. The Trinty Wharf staff were amazing. They exceed expectations with their amazing service, delicious food and friendly helpful attitude. Delegates raved about the venue.	Thank you! We appreciate your wonderful comments and do hope we see the NGINZ conference again in the next few years. Many thanks again.	5	8 July 2014	N/A
The hotel is good for a short stay, the room was clean and had everything that was required. The bathrooms are small and the shower very small. The rooms are also quite noisey. You can hear your neighbours and the doors closing etc The room came with a continental breakfast which had everything needed. Overall the short stay was pleasant and the hotel is in a good central location.	Dear Bewitched11, Thank you for your feedback, I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, and were able to take advantage of our complimentary continental breakfast, and our central location. If you were down this way in the future we could try and accommodate you in a quieter room. Regards Margaret	3	3 May 2017	N/A
From the ease of booking, through to check out, everything was 100%. Phill and Sophie are a wonderful couple, very welcoming and helpful. We stayed in the luxury room, on the top floor. The room very clean and well appointed, with a very nice bathroom. The breakfast is a standard choice, with a daily special, and the quality of the ingredients was first class.	Thanks for the great review Graham and Janet. It was lovely to have 'Whitby regulars' stay! Hope you see you again soon.	5	5 March 2019	N/A
"We stayed for 2 nights in room 105. Check-in was really quick, room was huge, jacuzzi bath was superb, staff brilliant, breakfasts excellent. Overall a very good experience as hotel was also in great central location. Only thing I would suggest, on returning to hotel from a few drinks, went to bar to order one last drink and fancied some ""nibbles"" but was advised hotel doesn't sell any form of nibbles at all.... A bit disappointing Other than this a superb stay"	Hi Rich Thank you for your feedback and your review after your recent stay at the Shankly Hotel. Looking forward to seeing you on your return Kind regards Emma Parry Front of house manager the Shankly Hotel emma@shanklyhotel.com	5	10 September 2015	N/A
Just returned from a lovely stay at the Francis visiting the Christmas markets. All the staff are brilliant and nothing is to much trouble. We stayed in a feature room 219 which was lovely but being at the front of the hotel was a little noisy for us so we asked to be moved to the back and the staff were great. The new room 212 was lovely, the bedroom was smaller but we had a sitting room. We had breakfast in the room which we couldn't fault and well worth the £5 tray charge. We arrived at 11.45 and parking wasn't a problem although its been increased to £17.50. Excellent hotel with great staff will stay again if visiting Bath	Dear G S, Thank you for your excellent review, we are sorry to see the first room was a little on the noisy side for you, but I am so happy to see the team were able to find you a room on the back to make your stay perfect. Happy to read you were able to get parking with us over this busy period, we do try to offer parking to as many guests as we can on the market weekends. We look forward to welcoming you back very soon. Kindest regards, Pash Naidoo	5	8 December 2018	15 December 2018
Friendly staff and a lovely hotel. The rooms are nice and clean, with everything you need in them. They also do breakfast, which was fantastic and very yummy. The place is not the Ritz but it is a great little hotel for anyone who wants somewhere to rest their head in lovely garden surrounds. We have stayed in less superior hotels than this, which were advertised as being modern etc, and have paid double. For value, friendliness, cleanliness and facilities, you can't get any better. Brilliant hotel.	Hi Tony, Wow thanks so much for taking the time to leave us this lovely review. It’s always great to have you both stay with us and we are happy to have you as regular guests. We definitely try to stay fairly priced whilst still keeping our rooms and building modern. Take care and we look forward to seeing you again next time. Cheers - Kimberly, Mario & Anthony	5	3 July 2019	N/A
Large clean room, comfortable bed, easy parking, great location, friendly staff. Easy access to restaurants and cafes. Far superior to other places we've stayed in the area. Will definitely stay here again. 	Dear O9283CZwendyb Thank you so much for your amazing feedback about our apartment, parking, location and guest services. We have recently moved our car park to ground level with direct access to reception and hotel lobby and I am so happy that you like this new set up. Thank you again and we certainly look forward to welcome you back to Adina St Kilda or to one of our TFE hotels in near future. Kind regards, Shirish Agrawal - Hotel Manager	5	29 August 2015	31 August 2015
Attentive, friendly and helpful staff will make your stay enjoyable. The hotel is beautiful and well located to ensure a quiet nights slee. Fantastic bed and pillows. Hot water was a little slow in coming but a full size bath made up for it.	Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for your kind review of a stay at The Windsor. A pleasure to read that our staff are so helpful and attentive. We shall have our maintenance team attend to the slow hot water. I do hope The Windsor will have the pleasure of your company again soon. Yours sincerely, Joe Joe Rainer Front Office Manager	4	12 July 2016	14 July 2016
This was the most amazing place to stay. Stayed two nights but I would recommend three would be perfect. Our villa room was so well appointed right down to the choice of pillows. The bed was so comfortable and the room very quiet. The staff have all been happy, friendly and obliging. The meals at the restaurant were very good. First night couldn't get a booking for restaurant, so ate in the bar restaurant which was quite good, you still get a view of the magnificent ocean from there. Breakfast was probably one of the best we have ever had and we do a lot of travelling. The infinity pool is gorgeous, great gym, equipment in good condition, so don't forget your gym gear, also unfortunately flies are a nuisance in this corner of WA so don't forget the aerogard and do take your binos for the whale watching from here if you come at whale watching time.	"Dear maeveMelbourne, Thank you for your great review, I am so pleased that you thought your stay to be ""Absolutely wonderful!"". We look forward to welcoming you back to this amazing place very soon. Kind regards, Bronwyn Bulpitt General Manager Pullman Resort Bunker Bay"	5	28 November 2013	N/A
We had to move here as our original hotel had a gas explosion and I am so glad we did. First the service here is second to none and the breakfast is great. Also we had afternoon tea here and it was a great experience even for my 12 year old daughter I would recommend it even if you are not staying here. The room was clean and a good size for London and the Wi-Fi worked all the time which is also a nice plus. We used the concierge to help with show tickets and directions and they did a super job even checking in with us while we were out with updates. It is a pricey hotel but what is not in London and you will not be disappointed with your stay at this classy hotel. Also the bed we had was so comfortable.	Dear guest, Thank you for sharing your kind review following your recent visit. I was very sorry to learn that there was an incident in your original hotel; however I am delighted that we were able to assist with ensuring that your holiday in London could continue. I am pleased that you were happy with the room and the free Wi-Fi service we provide and that you found the bed to be so comfortable. It is also wonderful that you had the opportunity to have afternoon tea with us and that you and your daughter found it to be a great experience. We like to ensure that all of our guests including children enjoy this and so your recommendation to others is most appreciated. We are very proud of our staff and it is always pleasing to receive such kind comments as yours. I am pleased that the Concierge team assisted with tickets and directions and that they updated you. We constantly strive to go beyond our guest’s expectations of service and it is fulfilling to hear that these efforts are noticed. I shall ensure that all of your kind comments and praise are passed on to the team. I hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you back to the Montague soon.

Home Inn suites is very close to the airport and convenient to many amenities. The hotel is very nice. The rooms are clean and comfortable. We were in the room right next to the elevator on the second floor and we were worried it would be noisy but we did not hear anything. Very quiet hotel. The breakfast was good. Very much like other complimentary breakfast you get at hotels. I did find the breakfast area a little crowded but not unpleasant. My only complaint is that I'm not sure if the toilet in our room had been cleaned. It had a residue buildup o In the tank, I did not notice until the day we left so I hope it was cleaned after we left. I would definitely stay there again in February.	"November 11, 2016 Thank you Margie M for taking the time to review the Home Inn & Suites Regina Airport West. I am pleased to read that you had a comfortable stay and you found the amenities in and around our property convenient to your needs . I will be sure to have a chat with my housekeeping team in regards to your concerns. We hope to welcome you ""Home"" again in February! Bianca Dutton General Manager"	4	November 10, 2016	N/A
Well this place was a little gem! Stayed overnight as I was watching a concert at the Millennium Stadium, which is conveniently located within 5 mins walking distance. The accommodation was spotless; beds were comfortable; great facilities included a fridge, kettle, microwave and toaster in our superior twin room, which also had a 32 inch flat screen tv and ample spaced shower. The breakfast in the morning was lovely - choice of cereals, yoghurt and a well cooked breakfast with 2 eggs. Nom!!! The best part of all though was the price - whilst other nearby hotels had hiked their prices up to over £200 a night due to the concert, Austin's charged the modest sum of £57 per room including breakfast for 2!!! Will definitely be coming back!	Thanks for your great review. Come back and see us again soon.	5	11 June 2013	N/A
I am so happy to be able to stay at the airport for an early flight. This hotel has huge windows so you can see the planes taking off and landing. The pool,jacuzzi and gym are perfect and clean. The dining choice is healthy salads and vegetables. At your bedside is a little vial of Lavender to roll on your temples for a good sleep. A+ Westin- you outdid yourself on this one.	Dear barcelonabrat, We are delighted that we exceeded your expectations for an outstanding stay. Our stunning architectural design, modern amenities, and stellar location moments from the terminals make The Westin Denver International Airport a great choice.

I stayed here for two weeks back to back for a business training. This hotel is attached to an upscale mall with restaurants and shops literally at your door. While a large hotel, the people at this Sheraton were extremely friendly and accommodating. I will say that I stayed on the eighth floor on the second leg of my trip, and had some issues with no hot water a few times, but overall the stay was nice and the staff tried their best to assist. I just can't say enough about how friendly and polite the staff are. There is a hot breakfast available every day, and although I only visited twice, everything was extremely fresh. The waitstaff are amazing. The facility is very clean and it appeared that the linens and bedding had even been updated between my stays. My room had a refrigerator, which was very convenient, as well. Housekeeping left fresh bottled water each day and my room was always very clean. I only give it a four because of the hot water issue. The rest was outstanding. I haven't had the best luck at Sheraton in the recent past (see my last review from another city) but this hotel more than made up for it. Kindness and hospitality really do make a difference, and the people at this Sheraton really are doing it right. I'd definitely stay here again when in Indy.	MWAinBTR, At the Sheraton we take pride in our team and how awesome they are, so thank you for noticing that and providing your feedback. I'm sorry to hear you had hot water issues during your stay. I've shared your feedback so what ever the issue was it's fully corrected going forward. We hope to see you again soon at the Sheraton at Keystone Crossing and wish you safe travels.	4	July 28, 2018	N/A
The welcome from Simon and Darryl is warm and relaxed, you enter the lovely old home and find it alive and ravishing with gorgeous bedrooms, crips Italian sheets smelling of lavender and piles of pillows. Sumptuous living rooms of couches you never want to get out of, art and books to fill any moment, a verandah for tea time over looking gardens and lawns, a swimming pool to ease in followed by chilled wine and canapés. It was very hard to leave. Simon and Darryl, you have created a haven for us all. Thank you.	Barbara - What a lovely review of your stay with us here at Terragong - your kind words are very much appreciated and we're so pleased to read that you had a memorable time with us! We very much look forward to welcoming you back before too much time has passed :) Warmest regards, Simon (& Darryl)	5	12 February 2017	N/A
Stayed here in a double + single three sharing. We arrived very early at about 10:30am with the hope to drop off our bags. Before we could even request that we were told we could check in! It cost no extra and we were given some ice cream as a welcoming treat. We get to the room on the top floor facing Fleet Street and waiting for us was a Crunchie, water and some ear plugs. We stayed fri-sun and yes you can hear the noise but on floor 4 it was actually alright and with ear plugs in we weren’t disturbed. We pointed out a few maintenance issues and due to the complexity of them we were advised it might not get fixed during our stay. Minor things like the door sticking and bathroom lock not working (but I was amongst friends!). We pointed these out more to a courtesy to other current & future guests. Guess what? Fixed that day! The ONLY thing is that being tall the shower was a bit rubbish and needs updating to the standard of the rest of the room. I think that’s ongoing. Would I stay again? YES! (Breakfast was €15 in advance at TOAST, very good for the morning after...we had this on the second morning)	Hi G P, Thanks for taking the time to write this kind review, So glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We pride ourselves on going the extra mile for guests, and glad that you got to experience this. We hope that we can welcome you back soon, Kind Regards, Lynne Carolan	5	5 October 2017	N/A
The resort was great but the restaurant at the resort was lacking staff and service and quality of the food wasn't great..Buffet breakfast was terrible. We arrived to nothing in the pots, and continually asking staff for food! I felt sorry for the girl working as she was the only one and had several ppl complaining to her! Overall we had a good time, it's just a shame about the restaurant as it's the only one on the resort!	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to review our property Oaks Pacific Blue. I am delighted to hear about your most recent stay with us, however, disappointed to hear about your experience with our restaurant. Please understand that this is not the standard that we strive for at Oaks. I will pass on your valuable feedback to our Food and Beverage staff members and we hope to welcome you back again in the near future.	3	10 April 2017	13 April 2017
Great location and near restaurants, movie theatre and main highway. The happy hour is really nice and they offer wine and beer. Nice place to stay when in town for business and other events. Staff are welcoming.	Hello malba471, Your feedback is incredibly important to us here at Homewood Suites Charlotte Ayrsley. Our team strives to be friendly, welcoming and always eager to delight our guests. We do pride ourselves on always providing top notch, exceptional service that keeps guests returning year after year. It is so fantastic to hear that you were able to experience and recognize that. We are incredibly proud of our Evening Reception - and thank you for taking the time to provide us with detailed notes to future travelers.

Thank you again, and we look forward to seeing you soon!	4	December 18, 2019	December 20, 2019

We used our point rewards to stay for a couple days, the rooms are nice and clean, the hotel is in a business district but still close to lots of shopping and food. If you happened to be in the area around December, make sure you check out the Christmas market just a couple of block walk.	Dear HistoryExplorer166, Thank for choosing the Charlotte Marriott City Center. We are glad you liked our wonderful location and had a great experience with us. Thank you once again for being our loyal guest, and we invite you to stay with us again soon! Thank you, Seamus Gallagher Director of Guest Experience	5	July 19, 2018	July 19, 2018
I was staying at this hotel as part of a work contract and must say that the whole experience was a rather disappointing one to say the least. The room itself faced out onto the main road which was also quite noisy throughout the night. The room was also tired and in need of a total overhaul to be brought in line with the amount that the hotel is charging guests currently. The staff themselves were very friendly but I did suffer the misfortune of having to eat in the restaurant. I selected a T-bone steak at a cost of £22.50 and as you can see by the accompanying image this was a most disappointing experience and one that, once again does not justify the cost. If you want to be pretty much in the centre of Cambridge then you can't go too far wrong but I would advise eating out as a definite and a re-furb should be a high priority for this rather tired and dated hotel.	Dear Darren A Thank you for the review and it is a shame you chose to endure the hotel room during your stay without asking at reception if there was an alternative we could move you to. We don't serve T Bone steak however again if you were unhappy with the product give us an opportunity to put it right rather than hiding behind the keyboard.

I recently stayed two nights for a wedding, along with many other out-of-town guests. The rooms were very nice and spacious, pool was wonderful and the restaurant/bar was an added plus. I only ate breakfast at the restaurant but it was great. There is a small office park for runners. However set your GPS to get there because it is quite hidden. The staff was wonderful. One down side is there is no shuttle to the airport.	Thank you for your review of our property. We hope that you will stay with us again. You mentioned that you do not like sleep number beds. We keep the dial on our beds set on medium. However, each guest can change it to his or her preference. We have information in each room about the bed and how to customize it to suit your preference. We hope that you will give our hotel and our beds another try. For personal travel, we are close to the Hard Rock Casino, Busch Gardens, Lego Land, Florida State Fairgrounds and MOSI. We also have a shuttle that travels in a five mile range. We hope to see you next time you are in Brandon.	4	March 8, 2012	N/A
The rooms are clean and comfortable, maybe a little on the small side, the pool is nice but not very big, the location is good (two blocks from everything) and the price is very good compared to everything around it.

I recently ran an event for thirty people at this Hotel and stayed the night before. The first thing to say is the hotel is under new independent ownership and it shows in a positive way. Meet and greet: All the hotel staff we met on arrival were warm, friendly and efficient. Rooms: We had a twin room, the room was clean, the sheets were crisp and clean, the bathroom was clean and without smells. The shower delivered hot water on demand. Ambience: This is a classic listed building - Open fires, creaky floors and shadowy corridors in a nice way - Just love the place. Food: We only had breakfast in the hotel, but the food was wholesome and the staff helpful to specific requests. Service: Nothing was too much trouble and it never came with a sigh or shrugged shoulders - just a positive attitude all round. They accommodated our group with ease and the overall atmosphere was relaxing and unstuffy. A good mix of locals and visitors whilst we were there. I will certainly be using this hotel again for future events.	Many thanks for taking the time to write your review. I am really pleased to hear that you had an enjoyable stay with us and that your event went well. We look forward to welcoming you back again in the future.	4	20 February 2013	N/A
We stayed here for 5 days/4 nights last week, & found the accommodation really good value for money. It is only a 10-15minute work down to Cable Beach. The Broome bus that runs every half an hour is fantastic & takes you everywhere, & the bus stop is just opposite the resort. Walking distance to some great bars & eateries also. Only disappointment was the Resort bar doesn't open until 5pm weekdays & 3pm weekends,	Many thanks for taking the time to post a review on your recent stay with us; your feedback is greatly appreciated. It is great to read that you found our rooms great value for money and the location and town bus service was of great advantage to you. We sincerely apologise that the restaurant opening hours weren’t what you were expecting. We are looking at options to extend our opening hours during the busy periods and we greatly appreciate this feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back to Oaks CBS next time you’re in Broome!	4	4 September 2013	8 September 2013
We stayed at the Carlton recently (at the end of the Big Snow!) before a flight abroad and were, once again, made very welcome. Our room was comfortable and cool, as requested! We were assisted by David and Noelle at Reception, who blended professionalism with friendliness, and helped with updates on flights and so on. We highly recommend the Carlton and would never underestimate the reduction in stress that staff like David and Noelle make possible. Happy customers! M & T O'Reilly-de Brún, Clonbur, Co.

Visited the park with our 5 and 8 year old boys. Our 8 year old enjoyed the lego robotics and has wanted us to purchase the robotis.

All rooms surround a patch of rain forest. So nice to sit on the patio and look at the foliage and, for us, the rain. Our helicopter flight was canceled due to rain (and the next day too) but I had lovely time reading whil my husband went out walking. Enjoyed the hot baths next door. Was fine in the rain - our private pool had a dressing room, bathroom and shower. The five course meal was absolutely fabulous. You need to book ahead. Had a pedicure in spa. Probably the shortest I have ever had but better than nothing.	Dear Patricia Thank you for your review as it is only through feedback like this that we can improve as a Hotel. Yours sincerely Richard	5	22 February 2019	22 February 2019
"A lovely and centrally located to the area beach holiday park resort in Albany. Our 2 level cabin was spacious and well appointed with views from the living level to the beach and surrounds. Easy access from car to apartment and beautiful walks from the cabin on the beach, around the bay and coastal walkways. Plenty to do in the area with great nature walks, historic sites and activities, great food in restaurants or wineries. Top walks also just inland in Mount Barker regions with unique top hatted restaurant set in the ""bush"" and some of the best wineries we have been to."

We stayed one night en route elsewhere. The rooms have just been upgraded and ours was first class. We signed up on-line for breakfast and dinner all in. The food was very good and substantial and reasonably priced for a hotel of this standard. The staff were very helpful and seemed to take a personal pride in the running of the hotel. Plenty of free car parking and very quiet.	Dear nikko56 Thank you for your 5 star review.

We stayed here for our first year wedding anniversary and enjoyed our stay. We received a free upgrade on checking in which was awesome and particularly useful as there was no restaurant on site (recently closed down) and we had not been made aware of this prior to checking in so the upgraded room included a kitchen which was defiantly needed for our stay. The room was a great size and very clean it had a amazing spa also. We received fresh towels daily including all the things we needed such as dish washing liquid. The bed was fairly firm which was a little uncomfortable but apart from that the room was great. The lagoon pool was awesome, we went across the road and got some inflatable boats from Kmart and the resort staff happily inflated them for us which was great. There seemed to be a lot of kids around especially considering our stay was mid week and not in school holidays so it did take away from the 'romantic get away' we were there for. All in all we had a great time, it would have been excellent if there was a restaurant there and if our room was located away from all the rooms with kids, however, with a free room upgrade I can't rally complain!	It is always a pleasure to hear that our guest have enjoyed their stay with us and despite the restaurant closure I am glad to see that you were still able to enjoy our facilities. Our restaurant will be re-opening in the near future and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.	5	13 November 2014	N/A
This is a small hotel-18 rooms. They treat you like family. The staff is wonderful. The rooms are great. Location is a block off the beach and on the inter-coastal waterway. Have dinner on the pier. The view is just wonderful! Could not have been better. Just 20 minutes from the airport.	Thank you for taking the time to write a review. On behalf of the our staff we thank you for the kind comments. At The Pillars guests always come first and we strive to provide the best service possible. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!	5	July 28, 2017	July 29, 2017
We stayed at the Hyatt Place on Waikiki before and after our recent cruise of the Hawaii Islands. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was clean and the complementary breakfast. We enjoyed making Friday afternoon at the complementary activity at the hotel.	Hi BrownsburgBoiler, Thanks for taking the time to share your review of Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach. We're happy to hear that our accommodations were the perfect fit before embarking on your cruise. We appreciate your compliments on our team members and look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to the island. Travel safely and join us again soon!	5	January 30, 2018	February 2, 2018
Everything you need in a service department including a dishcloth unlike some others recently reviewed. Onsite parking is reasonable at $15 compared to the other ripoffs around Sydney. Highly recommended location: $12 Uber into the city; 10 minutes from the airport; and walk to East Village Coles. Third stay already booked.	Dear Wellsy_the_Worker, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us and the TripAdvisor community. We are thrilled to read you once again found all the makings for a wonderful stay at Meriton Suites Zetland and do hope you were able to relax and unwind in our resort style leisure facilities throughout your stay.

Pros: Hip, fun vibe. Excellent food and evening jazz. Cons: Super loud! The music blasts through the hotel. No carpets makes for good decor but you can hear everything in the room above you, including folks walking around. The staff at the front desk and restaurant have an indifferent “we are doing you a favor” attitude.	Dear jamesfZ6007YN, Thank you for taking the time to share your comments and concerns regarding your recent stay at The Roxy. We would like to further look into your experience, as an opportunity for improvement. Please feel free to contact me directly at SRahman@roxyhoteltribeca.com and allow us the opportunity to better our services. We hope to welcome you back and restore your confidence in our brand.

I've got a very good service at executive lounge. Staff was awesome. Especially, Ms.Vicky and Ms.Marusha , they were so kind and polite. Night view here is also beautiful.

Although we were only spending one afternoon and night in Vancouver before returning home from Alaska, we totally enjoyed the Blue Horizon. Wonderful staff - extremely courteous and helpful - beautiful room - and right where we could do a 'hop on hop off' bus tour of this marvelous city. We were sorry we didn't have another night there.	Hello Susan W, Thank you for your glowing review -- we wish you could have stayed longer and explored more of our great city. We look forward to welcoming you back.	5	June 27, 2016	N/A
We were in Tampa to visit family . We have stayed in many Hilton’s, but this place was exceptional . Great staff !! Exceptional clean . Highly recommend this hotel ! The hot buffet breakfast had wonderful omelette ‘s , the evening reception was so nice with a wide selection of drinks after a long day of traveling and sightseeing . I will definitely be back for a future stay !	Thank you for the great review of our hotel. It is always nice to read that our guests enjoyed their time with us and that the service exceeded expectations.

Second time staying in the hotel and an ideal way to beat the January blues!. Four of us *2 ad and 2 child* Stayed in the 1 bed family suite and the room configuration was exactly as requested. The sofa bed could do with a bit more support in the mattress but its ok for kids. A bottle opener and wine glass or two would be a welcome addition but everything else in the room was great. Pool and gym are both decent - especially on a rainy day, and we had dinner in the bar. Could do with some background music in the bar which was busy but lacked atmosphere. Staff there were very attentive Breakfast the next morning was good - even though the selection may be a tad limited but still has all you could need. Underground parking was most welcome on checkout since the rain was monsoon like outside. Overall a great family break and hopefully will get back there again.	Dear jambo2jambo, Thank you so much for your review and for choosing to return to us! We are very pleased you had such an enjoyable stay with us. Our housekeeping team will be delighted that they helped make your stay as comfortable as comfortable. We are also glad you got a chance to use the leisure centre facilities, it is the perfect way to pass away a rainy day and to spend time together also! We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel again soon. Kind Regards, Maritime Management	4	22 January 2018	N/A
We stayed at this establishment overnight, before a very long return flight, next day, to L.A. We wanted a quiet, clean place and close to the airport with a restaurant on-site. This motel met all our expectations. It was sound-proof (did not hear any traffic noise or the overhead flights). It was a spacious, very clean large room with good furnishings and a decent workstation. The restaurant served an excellent meal at a reasonable price. I recommend this motel to any traveller.	Thank you for your great review on the Best Western Airport Motel & Convention Centre. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and appreciate that you will recommend our property to other travellers.	5	10 November 2014	N/A
We had an early flight out of Auckland Airport so we chose to stay at the Novotel Auckland Airport for one night. Well worth the money! Great location, we just had to stroll across to get to the airport for our flight the following morning. The staff are so helpful and welcoming. We had a great stay and loved the comfortable bed!	Kia ora Shona, So lovely to have welcomed you. What a thrill it is for me to read of the wonderful service from the team and to know that the convenience and comfort Our Place offered were so appreciated. We hope to see you back our way again.

We hadn't been to Newcastle for many years and what a great find this hotel was. Great value taking advantage of a bubbles offer and then from the lovely warm welcome from Neil on reception the warmth of the city came through. A superb room (317) great pre dinner drinks great cocktails lovely bar staff and a tasty breakfast. A warm goodbye to this great hotel and this great city. Location by the millennium bridge and a Sunday walk along the riverbank with a great pop up market nearby was great fun.	Dear tasty1111, Thank you for taking the time to write your review. It’s lovely to read your comments following your recent stay with us. I will be sure to pass your kind words on to Neil. We very much look forward to welcoming you back to Malmaison Newcastle again soon. Kind regards, Richard Lockstone General Manager	5	24 September 2017	N/A
Reception staff very efficient and polite but felt a bit too business like in approach, for me personally. The room (55) was spotless with a lovely little balcony, overlooking the patio area, which was lit up with fairy lights and a water feature. Room was very hot though (reason for sleep quality). Bar food was reasonably priced and tasty. Plenty of choice from buffet breakfast. A very relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. After watching Secret Millionaire about Best Western, I certainly think that this hotel has passed the standards required. WELL DONE	Dear Margaret K Thank you for such a great review and please accept my apologies for the temperature of your room. Each room is independently controlled by the Guest but with these huge temperature fluctuations in our weather at the moment, from -8C to +10C, it is very hard to find a happy balance - delighted however to read that you clearly had a lovely time. Best wishes and thank you again David F Miller Managing Director	5	19 March 2012	N/A
This was my first time staying. Amazing staff and extremely clean rooms! I would recommend this Hotel to anyone. They also have a bar!! This must be new for Hampton. I have never been in a cleaner room!	bayerlyg, Thank you for taking a moment to respond to a guest review. I'm delighted this was your first experience at our property and it exceeded your expectations! From our hospitable team and clean guest rooms to our on-site taproom bar, we are delighted to serve you with Asheville's utmost hospitality.

We reserved a room with a crib as we had a baby with us. First room we checked into smelled horribly of smoke.We were then given a room at the back alley. We tried a third roomon the second floor. Unlike other places we have stayed, the crib was not set up for us. We had to go up a VERY steep makeshift platform to get to our room. With a stroller,it was very dangerous because it was so steep. NOT safe at all & should not be allowed. We lost control of the stroller on the way down! Its a good thing the baby was not in it!!!We were very disappointed and wanted to get out to enjoy Banff so did not complain but certainly will not be going back. Safety is worth the extra to stay elsewhere and I cannot understand how this passes code for a hotel!	Dear Guest, We're sorry to hear you were not satisfied during your stay with us. It was myself who came and checked the room after you advised there was a smoke smell, and I could smell it very faintly. Most likely it had come in through the open window from someone smoking in the car parking area. The new room we gave you was just down the hall from the original, backing onto the car parking area once more (not an alley). In regards to the ramp, these are in place so that the housekeepers can navigate their supplies sufficiently through the hotel. These are easily pulled up and fastened against the wall, so that guests can safely proceed up and down the small flights of stairs. The ramps should always be in the upright position once housekeeping has finished for the day, so our sincere apologies for the issue you experienced with this. We are now looking at taking these out and changing our procedures for the housekeepers. Once again, we're very sorry for the issues you experienced, and hope you may give us another chance if you're ever visiting Banff in the future. Warm Regards, Laura Preston Front Office Manager	1	June 18, 2014	N/A
Excellent hotel of this class...great property and kept extremely clean. Front desk staff is very friendly. This stay was during several events in town and they handled groups well. Parking is convenient. I actually stayed here twice in the same week/ weekend. Second time back was upgraded to a suite which was very nice and spacious. I'll be back to this place and highly recommend to others when in the area.	Good Afternoon tbeckner2018, You’re a valued customer; everything we do is aimed at providing you with an excellent hotel experience and we're delighted we lived up to that.

Room was pleasant but felt dated. Bed was very small Good location for central Cambridge Did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food When I woke up there was no electricity working in the room. As I was leaving this did not really affect our stay.	Dear Paul B Thank you for the post and that our location suited your needs. We do hope to welcome you back again. Sincerely	3	3 October 2018	N/A
We have stayed at Palm Cove a number of times at different accommodations and always had wonderful holidays but our time at Alamander was without doubt the best of all. From the moment we arrived and greeted with welcoming drinks and fabulous friendly faces and service we knew we were staying somewhere special - thank you Avril for making our arrival special and Cedric and all the other reception staff for their exceptional service. Our apartment was awesome as was the whole resort and NuNu restaurant topped off the whole wonderdful experience. We have been up to FNQ a number of times and had decided this was possibly our last venture up there but Alamanda at Palm Cove has now convinced us a return visit is a must!	Dear Diane O, Thank you very much for your lovely review on TripAdvisor. We were glad having you back again at the magical Alamanda Palm Cove. The team and I are delighted to read that you enjoyed your best ever holidays with us ! We know it will not be long before you come back again. Warm regards, Cedric Lootvoet Guest Relations Manager	5	9 September 2017	N/A
What more could you ask for right? It was located very close to the strip, but far enough away to not hear all the noise from the strip. It was great walking over to Planet Hollywood shops to eat. They were right across the street. Maid came everyday. There were fun things going on in the hotel often. A beer at the bar was $9 and $14 for a margarita. My only complaint was our room wasn't ready so they said they would call us when it was. We waited 3 hours in the bar. Finally I went up to the front desk and said it's way after check in, what's going on. She said my room has been ready. Which made me upset. Everything else was great.	Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review. Your feedback is very important to us and has been shared with our senior resort management. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and hope you will join us again sometime.	4	June 6, 2017	N/A
Only three rooms - but all so well appointed, spacious and comfortable. Parking right out the front and in a good location in Busselton. Delicious breakfast served in your room for those who like their privacy. If you want to bring back take-away, all crockery cutlery and glasses provided. We were warmly welcomed by our hosts Ann and Ivan. While we settled in we were given scones with jam and cream - a nice surprise. So much thought has gone into what has been provided in the room. The bed was very large and comfortable. We look forward to many more visits while we build our house in the area and have already recommended Sojourn on Gale to family and friends.	Thanks for a wonderful review. As we stated on your Sojourn with us we look forward to meeting you again in the future. It is of course our pleasure to keep all our guests happy with great service and value. We love being so close to the beach, town and Jetty and while this time of year is not the best for those visitors wanting to enjoy the sunshine it is a great time to not be bothered by the crowds when sight seeing and relaxing. This and meeting new people is what holidays are all about. Best wishes for your future Sojourns'.	5	7 August 2017	N/A
Good atmosphere comfortable and clean fantastic bar staff under great pressure very busy, great coffee, live music was fab and food was delicious good all round, not cheap though.. Great views of the castle and grounds, in the middle of the town easy walking to all attractions, Trim castle is worth a visit, it was used in the Braveheart movie.	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post a review of your recent stay at Trim Castle Hotel on Trip Advisor. I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay in the hotel and in Trim. Thank you for all of your nice comments on the hotel. We hope that you will have an opportunity to return to Trim to visit us again. Kind Regards Patrick Reilly	4	23 September 2016	N/A

I was recently in Toronto for a conference and decided to stay at the Hotel X Toronto by Library Hotel Collection and I can only say one word ... WOW! This is my new favourite hotel in Toronto. I loved the spacious lobby, the modern design of my room, the water view, the Nespresso machine, the yoga classes, amazing gym, and the L'Occitane toiletries. If I were asked to provide a checklist of what I want in a luxury hotel, this would be it. I loved it so much that I want to come back with my family for a vacation.	Dear AHK403, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experience with us. We appreciate all your nice comments about our hotel and we are happy you enjoyed your stay. We truly hope to welcome you back soon when your travels bring you back to our great city! Warm Regards, Christopher L. Managing Director	5	August 21, 2018	August 22, 2018
I stayed here 2 weeks ago and what a great hotel, up graded to a suite it was superb, all the staff were very friendly and professional. I travelled solo but this hotel and it's location perfect for any traveller! surfing for the youngsters, a wonderful beach for the children, romantic walks for couples. Im an avid traveller and like quality accommodation and this place fits the bill in every way. A big thank you to management and staff :)	Thank you for your review, I am delighted you enjoyed the hotel, our staff and your visit overall. I am not sure if you are aware, but we offer a discounted solo rate, in the shoulder seasons. It has become very popular. Tim Hackett	5	July 28, 2015	July 29, 2015
"It's tough to describe what was wrong with this hotel. Let me start by saying the service was nice and the room was clean. But the hotel itself is kind of scabbed together so that it's in two sections, with this huge, cavernous area off from the main part of the hotel. We were unfortunate enough to get a room assigned in the scabbed-on part; it was a big room, oddly dubbed a ""presidential suite,"" and though it was big it was just kind of thrown together, with an assortment of furniture strewn about with no apparent plan. The breakfast area was in the same giant, gaping part of the hotel, again with tables just strewn about willy-nilly. Because the area was so capacious, sound echoed and, once the cleaning lady decided to vacuum the carpets, you couldn't have a conversation over breakfast. The breakfast itself was pretty low-effort and minimal, without even potatoes or anything a vegan might want to eat, and faux coffee (made from syrup rather than actual grounds). The neighborhood itself was dodgy without any sort of restaurant even remotely nearby. We drove a couple of miles in either direction through ghettos looking for something to eat before returning to the hotel and ordering delivery, which took 90 minutes to arrive."	Dear TedSLC, Thank you for taking the time to write a review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations. I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Sincerely, Jeff Lewis, General Manager	3	July 18, 2019	N/A
A very nice hotel in a great Eyre Square location. A fridge in the room and/or an ice machine would have been great, but overall a clean modern room. Included breakfast was also very good. Would come again	Dear Guest, Thank you for your review and for the feedback on your stay. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed your breakfast in HYDE and that our central location made it easy for your to explore Galway. We will look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Kindest Regards, Douglas Niland	4	22 September 2018	25 September 2018
We stayed two nights, one night in an annex room and one night on the top floor of the main inn. Beds are very comfortable. The annex room was large, two double beds and had a desk for working. The annex room also had a frig and microwave which the inn room did not. The inn room was furnished with a queen four poster bed which took up most of the room. There was a desk but only for decoration as it was slanted when open and no desk chair. Bathroom was about the same in both rooms but there was no grab bar in the tub in the inn room. Excellent location but limited parking, we were there on the weekend and could park on the street, I don’t know where you park during the week if the small lot is full. Staff very friendly and helpful. We had two breakfasts (not included) which were good and a dinner which was good also. Good coffee too! Ask for a ground floor room in the annex if you don’t like stairs.	Good afternoon, Thank you for your lovely comments on our staff, food and rooms. It was a pleasure to have you visiting with us. I am looking into your review on the Inn desk and will fix it should I encounter a problem. Thank you for letting me know. All of our rooms has one or two chairs. I understand from your review that you had a problem with the parking. This is unusual but can happen at times. If this had of been brought to my attention or the attention of your front desk person one of our staff would have been happy to remove their car from the lot so you would be able to get a space. I am sorry that I was not aware of your parking problem. . I am happy to hear that you had a good sleep. Thank you so much for the review and I do hope we will have the pleasure of a second visit in the future. Have a great summer. Pat Sands	4	July 8, 2018	N/A
Stayed one night at this hotel on business. The room was sea facing and pleasant though the bathroom was very old fashioned and not 4 star. The room did not have air conditioning and this proved a problem as both window and patio door only opened slightly. I understand this is Euro requirements but the room was very hot and at night it was impossible to keep windows open due to noise from outside so had a disturbed night due to the heat. If like this in April cant imagine what it must be like in the summer. Used the gym which was good and staff were very helpful. Would return but not in the summer.	Dear SDG6, Thank you for your review on The Old Ship Hotel. You’ll be pleased to know that The Old Ship Hotel will be going through a refurbishment plan so this will rectify the issues raised in your review. I am glad that my friendly, helpful staff and gym facilities met your expectations on this occasion. I do look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Kind regards, Paul Wright General Manager	3	23 April 2015	N/A
Hotel was an old property bought by Hilton. It was hot in lobby area rooms were small and the online pictures make them look much nicer than they actually are. The hotel is a long walk from the beaches.	Aloha, Thank you for staying and sharing your review. Our apologies your experience was less than satisfactory, and that the temperature in the lobby and room size were less than comfortable for your stay. We appreciate your feedback and if your travels bring you back to Waikiki we hope you'll give us another chance. Mahalo, Hilton Waikiki Beach Guest Services	1	August 28, 2019	August 30, 2019
We held a conference at the property. The staff was exceptional. I came in a day early and even though they had a 500+ guest event they made time to help me resolve a few issues that had nothing to do with them. I work with multiple properties and if you are in Charlotte absolutely give them a chance, you will be very happy you did!	Dear Jeremy B, It was such a pleasure hosting you and the attendees of your event. We strive to provide an exceptional experience and it's very rewarding when we receive such positive feedback.

We spent one night here as a turn around point on our road trip up the coast of Lake Superior. It is a ways off of the main highway. The room was clean, staff was very nice. I got a discount on the room using my Wyndham points. If not for that I would have spent an extra $20 to stay at a nicer place.	Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us.

I recommend this hotel it was centrally located for all of my activities. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was top notch. There were restaurants in the vicinity and a Walmart at the next exit to buy those items I forgot.	Hello robertmJ5261PY, We appreciate, you taking the time, to leave us a review on TripAdvisor.

From end to end the whole experience here was great. Really good value for money and a bookings team that were available when needed. Really friendly front desk staff who gave our kids lots of activities to do in the room. Nice clean room with everything we needed and a fantastic breakfast that came included in our room rate. All of the food was fresh and well prepared with lots of choice too. They even gave us a free drink at the bar. Nice pool that the kids enjoyed in the morning and hotel was really well located, right next to the Beehive. I rarely complete online reviews but felt that this place deserved it!	Dear Berwood76, What a lovely review, more so because you rarely complete on-line reviews. It is very rewarding to read that your experience was great from your initial contact with our reservation team, through to checking out. I know that our team enjoy reading positive feedback from our valued guests when they (we) have delivered such a positive stay experience. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with the TripAdvisor community. Kindest regards Marcus	5	29 October 2019	30 October 2019
Recently had a 3 night stay at Lake Crackenback and stayed in a 3 bedroom chalet with family. The chalet was lovely, spacious rooms, large living area, 3 king size bedrooms, 2 large bathrooms, separate laundry and drying room, not to mention superb views. The kitchen was very well equipped for self catering. Lots of free activities were great, unfortunately the weather wasn't so great so on a very wet day we ventured into the Games Room - very disappointing and definitely in need of a makeover, hardly any games in there, but we were able to borrow some board games from reception. Lots of activities we didn't get to try because of the rain but managed some superb walks, would recommend the walk to Bullocks Hut, scenery is superb. We ate at Alpine Lader for breakfast, lunch and dinner but were disappointed they don't have a dedicated children's menu, options for children were pizza or one pasta dish and nothing for younger children. There was little variation between lunch and dinner menus. Hope to return to the resort in the summer and particularly welcome their 3 for 2 deals.	Dear Morris80, Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent stay at Lake Crackenback Resort & Spa. I was so pleased to hear that your family getaway was so enjoyable. Sorry that the weather didnt hold out for you so that you could enjoy all the free activities we have to offer Thank you for telling us about your disappointement with the Games Room and the menu and Alpine Larder. I will pass yoru comments onto our team for discussion. Thanks again for your comments, we look forward to seeing you back at the Resort soon, in the meantime we invite you to join us on Facebook and Twitter to keep updated with the latest events on at the resort.

Still one of the most beautiful properties on the strip along excellent shopping and dining all on property. Customer service is second to none and it doesn't matter who you are, The Palazzo treats you like a welcomed guest. We have stayed at The Palazzo before and I always take back a positive expereince. Here's my latest great experience: while on business, I took my wife with me. She had a blast shopping and enjoying the pool. Upon check out day, I went downstairs to speak with guest services and explained I would be gone and couldn't get back in time before check out time to pick up my wife. They said no problem and make accomodations to remedy the situation. I was taken back by the excellennce in customer service. Thank you Palazzo for being best in class!	Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind words and feedback! There is no greater satisfaction, as a customer service professional, than receiving kind words from a valued guest. Providing unmatched guest service is a hallmark of our property and I am especially pleased to read that you felt this commitment during your stay. It was my pleasure to share your positive experience with our team. They truly appreciate hearing from satisfied guests like you, and we all look forward to your return.

From when we checked in to time of departure the Manageress was extremely friendly and obliging. The room was large and very well appointed and spotlessly clean. It was a short walk to town and very quiet.You need to take any refreshments you want because there are no shops nearby. I would thoroughly recommend this property to anyone staying in Margaret River.	Hello wilbur12, thanks so much for your review. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay & we are so grateful for your recommendations. We hope to see you again soon! Kind regards, Emma	5	12 December 2018	24 December 2018
Had a nice stay here. Joseph Downling, guest relations manager, greeted me as I checked in. After hearing of the long travel time I had, he sent an Irish coffee to my room! Greatly appreciated. There was a bit of a mix up in whether breakfast was included in my rate. I felt this took longer to fix than it should have. The overall ambiance and location certainly overrides this inconvenience. Rooms are beautiful and again, location is the best!	Dear Maureen M, Thank you for posting your review following your recent stay with us at The Westbury Hotel. I was delighted to read how much you enjoyed your stay and I appreciate your wonderful comments about my colleague Joseph who was thrilled to read your kind words. I am happy that we made your stay so memorable and I am glad we were able to sort out the difficulties with your breakfast package.

My family stayed at Big4 Ballarat Goldfields Holiday Park over the Australia Day weekend, and would highly recommend it. When I arrived to check in, the male staff member who served me was very friendly, he went well above my expected level of service when he offered and proceeded to take us to our site and reverse guide me into our site with our Camper trailer. Whilst I was getting the kids out of the car he unlatched the trailer from the car, helping to position it correctly. He then went off doing his other tasks but came back later to make sure I was ok setting it up, and gave me extra help when I was struggling. The next day when he saw us he even asked the kids how they liked sleeping in the camper trailer. My family used the tennis courts, jumping bag, play ground, kids craft activities, camp kitchen and shower blocks, all were clean and up to a standard we have come to enjoy with a Big4. Our stay felt very relaxing and had a personal touch to it. We will defiantly be recommending to family & friends.	As a family owned and operated business we understand how challenging it can be to holiday and camp with children, Lisa so we always do everything possible to make sure that Mum and Dad give a break too! We are so pleased that our efforts helped you enjoy your time at BIG4 Ballarat Goldfields and hope to see you return again soon.	5	3 February 2015	N/A
"I've stayed at this location while traveling cross country many times over the last 4 years. After a very long remodeling process, the rooms are mediocre at best. Garbage in the hallway, sketchy people hanging out in the parking lot and pubic hair on the ""freshly cleaned"" bedding. The mattresses appear to be work and felt lumpy. The stench of urine in the stairway. Security doors that don't lock. Parking lot lights didn't work. They weren't on until almost 11 pm after several guests voicing safety concerns. It's ridiculous. The other LaQuinta locations in OKC, I will just never stay at this one again."	Dear Valued Guest, We are very sorry to hear of your negative experience while staying with us. We appreciate the constructive critique, as we are continuously striving to improve our guest's experience. It is only through your feedback that improvements are considered and made. Our hope is that you will give us a chance to better serve you in the future. We very much appreciate your business and thank you for staying with us. Sincerely, Danielle LQ Customer Care	1	October 9, 2017	October 9, 2017
This place needs a facelift, deep cleaning and serious renovation. The beds are like cement slabs, the bedding is old and very worn. The furniture is old and the chairs seats are wobbly and about to fall off. It appeared that they tried to do some renovations in the bathroom but nothing extensive. A side of the old wardrobe was removed in order to accommodate a flat screen TV. The carpets are dirty and worn and questionable in many spots. Same as most of these old two floor walk ups that are prevalent in the Choice Hotel chain, the heater have two temperatures smokin' hot and freezing cold. Also added to the crappy heaters, they are most often rattle and clank. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, too bad they don't have a hotel to match their enthusiasm.	Dear Mr. Fred L Thank you for taking the time to write a review. I would like to apologize for your stay not being perfect. I understand your thoughts regarding a renovation and can inform you that we are already underway. We have started building a new lobby and breakfast room and upon the completion of that we will be doing the rooms later in the year. I am happy to hear that the staff was great while you were visiting and I assure that soon the entire hotel will be brand new. We appreciate your business and we look forward to welcoming you back to see the new look. We are very excited about the reno as it is a long time coming. Kindest Regards and take care Jason King General Manager Comfort Inn London	1	March 17, 2014	March 19, 2014

	Thank you for your review. Please accept my sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations on this occasion. We are awaiting delivery of a new platform lift. Again, my apologies for this inconvenience. I have asked my operational team to review both the Breakfast offering and the unacceptable bar service. Thank you for your feedback. I hope that you will consider returning to the Carlton and afford us the opportunity to extend you a warm welcome. Regards, Stephen Allison, Cluster General Manager.	3	5 July 2016	6 July 2016
We loved the location of this hotel. Close to the cruise ship dock and the airport, as well as convenient for using water taxi and trolley to get to shopping or the beach. The grounds and views of the canals and yachts made the hotel's setting simply beautiful.	Dear TripAdvisor Member, Our hotel is in a lovely part of Fort Lauderdale, right on the Intracoastal Waterway where the Water Taxi stops, with restaurants and shops along 17th Street. We’re happy you stayed with us and thank you for sharing your feedback. Please come back soon.

Thank you so much for your review of our hotel. I am pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us. It's something our staff takes great pride in, so we value your feedback. We hope you will visit us again. Sincerely, Todd D Assistant General Manager	5	February 9, 2017	N/A
A romantic stroll through the gardens led to the rather quaint and peaceful main building where we enjoyed pre-dinner drinks from the bar before continuing to an elegant dining room for dinner and again the following morning for an exquisite breakfast. The room was well presented with the privacy of the twin spa protected by some bushes. The staff were extremely pleasant at all times.	Dear darrenb222018 Thank you for your review and survey. We really appreciate your feedback. Kind Regards	5	18 September 2018	N/A
I stayed in room 301, king size, overlooking the beach (worth the windows being a bit dirty). The size was reasonable but the furniture is a bit old, the wardrobe was very hard to open (there were no hangers) and the cleaning was good despite the large spider web above one of the windows. In the bathroom it was more or less clean, but the liquid soap and shower gel were not full and clean. The next day's cleaning was to puce the sheets and change the towels (could do a little more). The noise from the street is too much. The small lunch, does not have many choices but the pancakes were delicious and not very sweet, good to start the morning :) The staff is friendly and attentive.	Good afternoon Sara, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to write your review. Happy to read you enjoyed the accommodation and great views. We hope to see you again soon. Kind regards, Stephen Hogg	3	25 August 2017	N/A
I got married in Creswick in Feb and booked to stay at this place for 2 nights - 1 with my bridesmaids to get ready and 1 with my husband. Very spacious apartment with 2 bedrooms upstairs, each with their own ensuite (toilet and shower) and a massive tub in each as well. Downstairs has a spacious lounge room, dining area, kitchen and laundry with another toilet as well. Everything we needed to for a short stay and the beds were super comfortable which was a pleasant surprise. Would definitely stay again.	Dear miz_mandah, Congratulations on your wedding! We are so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay in our 2 Bedroom Apartment. Thank you for your fantastic feedback. We look forward to your next visit. Kindest regards, Joanna	5	25 June 2018	N/A
Got there between 11 am & 11:15 am & my room on the 1st floor was ready!!! Which is a big improvement over the last two stays. About 4:15 pm to 4:30 pm I tried to call the front desk for a wake up call & extra towels & the phone wasn't working. I went to the front desk & told them the phone wasn't working & made the other requests. I went back to my room & with in 5 minutes maintenance came & fixed the phone. I left the room at 6:45 pm still no extra towels. Got back to the room a little after 9 pm, still no extra towels. Had to make a 2nd call before the towels were delivered. Later that evening I tried to find an outlet to plug my phone charger, & there were no easily accessible, or visible. outlets. For a hotel that caters to business people you would think that there would be outlets all over the place. It might have been just that room, because I don't remember having that problem the prior 2 stays.	Dear Miriam, Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay. The team has been working diligently on making improvements, particularly in fielding requests during convention arrivals where there are hundred of rooms checking in and contacting the desk for requests. We are happy to hear that some improvements have been made and will continue our Guest Service log to utilize as a guide to determine when service requests have been completed. We will request a check of your room and are hopeful to identify it by your first name to ensure an outlet and USB block is available in your room. The blocks are located on the nightstand of each guestroom to ensure easy access for devices. We are sorry to hear it may be missing in your assigned room and will replace it. We hope to see you again and look forward to your feedback on the continued improvements we have been working toward. Sincerely, Angela Kearney	3	November 29, 2017	N/A
Excellent quiet hideaway amongst the trees, great location with easy access to beach and restaurants. Very helpful service, nothing was a problem. Well maintained and clean. Bonus free wifi for whole stay and member’s card for the Surf Club was a nice surprise.	Thanks for taking the time to post a review. It is good to know that your stay was relaxing and tranquil.	5	7 October 2018	8 October 2018
Just returned from a perfect couple of days staying at Highcliffe House. Could not be more impressed, we were met by the charismatic Jason, nothing is to much trouble for this guy, he more than made us feel welcome. We stayed in the Countisbury room, with a fantastic view over Lynton and the hill from which the room is named. The Countisbury room was very comfortable, especially the big comfy bed, plenty of usb charging points for the many gadgets we seem to travel with these days. Breakfast was an absolute feast, from just out of the oven croissants, fruit, cereals through to a very tasty cooked breakfast. Highcliffe is perched on a very steep hillside which gives it the benefit of some amazing views. From what we experienced, this place is faultless, would love to go back.	Such a wonderful review, thank you so much for taking time to write it. We're delighted to read that you had such a great stay at Highcliffe House and found the additions to the bedrooms useful. We would love to welcome you back. Have a great Summer, Best wishes, Neal & Jason	5	29 April 2019	16 May 2019

"Impeccable hospitality. Fantastic. From the moment I registered to my good-bye hug a few days later, I loved this hotel. Rooms were elegant, well appointed, beds incredibly comfortable, and the amenities ... exactly right. The location, next to the Yarra River, is scenic and well situated for Melbourne activities. The breakfast buffet was an incredible variety of delights; lunch was terrific (I had a bowl of delicious soup with a side salad one afternoon .... and the lunch buffet another day, etc.; and, dinner was outstanding. I stayed a few days at another hotel in Melbourne, but decided to move to the Latham ... I am so glad I did. The Latham is excellent. When you hug the front desk staff because a heartfelt ""Thank you!"" or ""Good-bye!"" isn't enough, the hotel is doing something very, very right and very, very special. I love this hotel. Well done, Latham. Truly excellent."	Thank you for taking the time to post your review of The Langham Melbourne on Trip Advisor following your recent night stay.

We had a great time staying at Hyatt in waikiki. The hotel is recently renovated.The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was nice and big and the beds extremely comfortable. Different variety for breakfast served outside. There's a pool as well but we spent our time at the beach and never used the hotel pool. Nicely located close to Kuhio avenue as well if you need public transportation in order to go to Hanauma bay, Diamond head, Ala moana center etc. We returned to Waikiki after a week in Maui and chose a different hotel, but regretted our choice and wished that we had booked Hyatt for the rest of our stay as well. Grab Charlies taxi to & from the airport with $ 29 flat rate:)	Dear noreen_11, Mahalo for your review. We are flattered to learn that you had such a wonderful and comfortable stay at the all new Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach.

What a fantastic place. We stayed in a Beachfront villa and it was everything we could have asked for. The room was comfortable and clean, and the view was absolutely breathtaking. The second we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and a wonderful attitude. The park felt very safe and my daughter thoroughly enjoyed her time on the jumping pillows which were located just at the bottom of the hill from the villa, so we could keep an eye on her without having to leave the villa in the mornings. We collected groceries from the Countdown a 2 minute drive away, and cooked up some delicious fare using the communal BBQ and out kitchen utilities in our room. For the price, this was positively the nicest place I have ever stayed. I will dream of Papamoa until I have the chance to return!	Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay with us at Papamoa Beach TOP 10, we are so please you had such an enjoyable stay and that you wrote such a great review. We take great pride in our Resort and the customer service we provide. Up until October this year we have our mid winter deal where you get 35% off your stay!

We visited here at short notice following a booking disaster with another hotel in Brighton. We had stayed at this hotel not long after it opened nearly 10 years ago and hoped the standards would still be very high - The good news is they are! The staff were ALL very attentive, friendly and helpful and are a credit to the hotel. Our room, one of the top floor ones, was top notch and had nice little touches like a free spa gift bag and slippers. On Sunday we received a complimentary copy of The Times, which again was another nice touch. My only negative feedback is that the carpet leading up the many flights of stairs was very worn and dirty - as this is one of the things you first see I think it would be an idea to hoover it more regularly as it certainly gave me unfounded preconceptions of how clean our room would be!	Dear JayNewGatwick, Thank you for your lovely feedback and we're really pleased that you found Drakes still maintains our high standards 14 years on. We work hard to assure this is the case in all departments, whether it's quality of the furnishings or food and in our customer service. Thank you for raising the issue about the stair carpet. It is hoovered as the last job our Housekeepers undertake before finishing their shift. It is possible that you checked-in before it was done but I will certainly pass your comments on to our Head Housekeeper to look into and see what changes can be made to ensure the carpets are always maintained to a high standard.	5	19 December 2017	N/A
We stayed here with our 3 children (all under 10) for 3 nights. We traveled to London to visit nearby family and to also have our children experience London for their first time. We booked a family package at the Langham that included breakfast, which was served at the Roux at The Landau, a tour of the Hamley's toy store, and an afternoon children's tea at the Palm Court. The breakfast included both a beautiful buffet spread and a made-to-order menu. Our children enjoyed the tour of Hamleys and particularly enjoyed the children's-themed afternoon tea at the Palm Court. The room itself was lovely and spacious enough to accommodate the five of us. The staff members went out of the way to make us feel comfortable. The children loved their first trip to London and it was made even more special because of our stay. They are looking forward to another visit to London and to another stay at the Langham.	Dear 323gvdmd Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay here at The Langham, London with your family. I am delighted to learn that you all thoroughly enjoyed your stay and that the children in particular enjoyed the tour of Hamley’s and our very popular Children’s Afternoon Tea in Palm Court. We pride ourselves on being a family orientated hotel……..offering unique packages that suit children of all ages. I am thrilled that your children enjoyed their stay…….happy children = happy parents! Thank you for choosing The Langham, London as the venue for your family vacation and I do hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming you all back to the hotel in the not too distant future.

Very convenient hotel and very accessible from the motorway for Leeds east. The continental breakfast was very good value but we would have preferred to see more fresh fruit available on the menu. The room price was much higher than we anticipated following your email adverts for rooms at £29.95 and above.	Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely review., I am glad that you found our location conveneient and glad that you enjoyed our continental breakfast.

Every sound transmits through the floors and walls into the very early morning hours. They need to beef up the soundproofing when their architects design these hotels. Also every day housekeeping did not replenish the shampoo and shower gel. I had to call the front desk each day to get more.	Thank you for staying at the Wingate Tampa.

Recently stayed here for one night after an international flight and glad we did. Conveniently located right at the door of the international side of the airport. Hotel offers a shuttle service to domestic if needed. Being so tired we ordered room service. Was a bit on the expensive side but the food was so worth it! The beds are the best!!! We have stayed here a few times and will continue to do so. Staff friendly and very helpful. As it is a airport hotel it is perfect for a night stopover but not recommend for longer stays.	it is wonderful to hear from a very valued regular guest. It is great to see another comment on our famously comfortable Rydges Dream beds. Cheers, Tish General Manager	5	5 June 2015	N/A

We stayed for four nights in all sorts of weather and still had plenty to do even if it was a dreary wet day. With the park being close to many lookouts, great hiking tracks, Brumbuk Cultural Centre, little bikes to hire for the kids, pools, jumping pillow, movies for kids giving parents some quiet time, friendly atmosphere, great restaurants nearby, entertainment was plentiful. The park itself was kid friendly, clean with helpful friendly staff and the accommodation very clean. It was just great to see so many happy faces.	Thanks Rohan, Halls Gap does offer something for everyone. Whether you want to just stay in the park and play or relax or explore all that the Grampians have to offer.	5	2 January 2015	N/A

My partner and I stayed at the hotel for one night 27August 2018 to celebrate her birthday. First time we stayed there. It certainly will not be our last. The staff were friendly. Gave excellent service and were very professional. Although we had a problem with the air condition they promptly addressed the issue. Although offered another room we opted at their suggestion to have a portable heater which quickly arrived and was very good. Check in and check out were quick and efficient. We would recommend this hotel to anyone. We will certainly use te hotel on our monthly trips to Sydney	Dear John P, Wishing your partner a Happy Birthday!

I have stayed at this Red Roof Inn numerous times. Yes, one could quibble about the linens, the bedding, and a few other amenities, but overall I do not think you could find a better deal. It is not for you if want first class accommodations. If, however you want a decent place with friendly staff and a great price, I highly recommend the Red Roof Inn at Brandon/Tampa.

I like the hotel, however I was disappointed breakfast was not provided. I have stayed at less expensive hotels and it was provided. I enjoyed the flavored water. It was a nice touch with the weather being HOT.	Aloha and thank you for recently staying with us and for your nice evaluation and rating on our property. I'm sorry that we were not able to provide breakfast, but we do offer guests a discounted rate on breakfast at the restaurant located in front of the hotel.

I just got back today from 3 nights at this property. The exterior of the building is no better than a Marriott from 1976. The interior is no better than a Marriott in 1997. Surely the hotel knows it, it's such a bummer given the grandeur experienced across the brand globally and the potential for something great in Sydney. The housekeeping never came to clean my room one night even after I called them to come. The spa is hardly a spa and the gym is literally freezing, not even a nice level of cool for a workout, freezing. The pool is awful and the lounge chairs are sun stained and it looks like someone rubbed a terra cotta brick across them. I wanted so badly to give them a great review but I am afraid the hotel probably knows everything of what this review says. Definitely trying The Park Hyatt next time.	Dear Bentleydad, Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay at Four Seasons Hotel Sydney. I regret to read that your experience fell short of your expectations, especially in regard to housekeeping as this does not reflect our usual high standards. We will certainly take your valuable comments on board. I am pleased to share that we have just installed new furniture and a lush vertical garden at our pool area, and we hope we have the opportunity to introduce you to the refreshed space should you return to Sydney soon. Overall I do hope you were able to experience our friendly service and enjoy our fantastic hotel location, and had an enjoyable time in Sydney all in all. With kind regards, Rudolf van Dijk General Manager	2	8 December 2016	N/A

The hotel is very well located, right on Sandy Row, close to the city center.

Was here in the winter of December 2016 for a business trip with fellow guests for one night we needed a base for Dublin meetings. The location looked right, the reviews looked right so booked this one for me and my guests and no regrets, the experience for a short stay was better than expectations, everything I want was there, clean rooms, parking, free wi fi, good food and service, efficient and friendly staff without that fake smile, we landed, had lunch, done the business, rested, enjoyed breakfast and gone, see you next time.	Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review. I am delighted we lived up to your expectations. We look forward to your next visit. With kind regards, John Loughran Owner	5	5 January 2017	11 January 2017
"If you want pampered hotel luxury at ho-hum motel prices; this is the place to stay in Branson. The desk and breakfast room staff extend every effort to make your stay memorable. Their location in the center of the ""strip"" made making show starts easy. They have both indoor and outdoor pool and an exercise room.The grounds though small are very pretty and well maintained. There is even a public room with veranda overlooking the pool with comfortable chairs, newspapers and coffee available at all times, The rooms are clean, well maintained each with their own balcony. The beds are comfortable with two types of pillows.Breakfast is advertised as being continental, but is really a full buffet breakfast spread with different types of eggs and at least 2 breakfast meats every morning. .Like most Branson Hotels it is built on a hill which could create a problem for handicapped people like myself, but their staff made certain I always had a level place to park and easy access to the hotel. WELL WORTH A STAY!"	Thank you for your review of our property! I'm so pleased you enjoyed your stay and to hear our staff & hot, full breakfast, front desk & breakfast staff, pools, work out room, grounds and balconies were wonderful! Please visit us again when you vacation in Branson in the future!	5	May 1, 2013	June 2, 2013
"We stayed here for a few nights and were pleasantly surprised. Even though there are renovations going on to the front desk and a new ""soon to open restaurant"" (the old resto is still there but they only offer eat-in for breakfast but room service is still available) we did not feel that the service was lacking. The new Tempo resto should be nice as it will be on the main street (Barrington) level with the main front desk. The temporary front desk was/is located on the floor below which is a sort of basement but on one side connects to the pedestrian street behind which is home to NSCAD (College of Art and Design) and many shops, restos, bars etc. My favorite street in Halifax. Has a European feel! And back to the hotel.... The room was on the top floor (3) and overlooked the pedestrian street and the harbour front. It was rainy/foggy so couldn't see much. Had room service. Great! Had requested a newspaper and a few other things and they were promptly and courteously delivered. Kudos to the staff!"	Hello from Delta Barrington, Thank you very much for choosing us on your recent visit and taking the time to share feedback on your stay. We are trilled to hear you enjoyed your hotel experience and our city alike. Our renovation project is almost complete and we are very excited and eager to open TEMPO to our guests. Thank you again for choosing us... we look forward in welcoming you back to the new Delta Barrington soon! Best, Donnie MacDonald donnie.macdonald@deltahotels.com	4	September 25, 2012	N/A
Hotel was very busy as it was Labor Day weekend and it was Ohio's home opener, a family reunion that had 150 members staying and our class reunion. The staff handled everything like true professionals, the hotel lobby was clean and welcoming, the shuttle driver Sandy was the best and very pleasant. Will definitely stay again!	We aim to provide each and every guest with a comfortable, friendly experience at Embassy Suites Columbus, so it's delightful to know we were successful with your visit. Our team will be thrilled to hear you noticed their calm yet focused service, and we'll be sure to share your praise with Sandy as well. Thanks so much for the five-star rating and join us again if you return to town.	5	September 6, 2018	September 7, 2018
we stayed in this hotel and from the moment we arrived to when we left everything was top class.when we checked in the lady informed us we had been upgraded to a suite which was a lovely touch.the room was fantastic ,it even ha a t.v. in the bathroom.Every night there was a choclate left on the bed and the bed turnedown.the breakfast was on of the best I've had with a wide range of food (something to please everyone)and I dare say nobody will ever go hungry here.The lounge in the evening is a lovely place to relax and have a coffee or a drink, it has a very calming feel about it .Overall a really great hotel.	Dear Megane17, Thanking you for leaving us such nice positive review. I am delighted to read our comment about our facilities and service. We always try to provide the best service ever and to maintain our high standards. I am glad that the extra little touches like the turn down service and chocolates helped to make you stay memorable. I am also delighted that our breakfast had the “wow” factor and that the lounge had a charming and relaxing feeling. It was a great pleasure to have you stay here at The Westbury and we hope that you will return to stay again soon. Regards, Vincent O’ Gorman General Manager	5	26 September 2013	N/A
"several of us stayed for a couple of nights and couldn't fault the rooms. The conference facilities were very good, although the room wasn't ""refreshed"" during lunch with more bottles of water etc. Standard of lunch buffet was good, but a bit slow in refilling dishes. Plenty of ladies toilets, so no complaints about queuing!! All the staff we met were extremely polite and helpful. We didn't have dinner at the hotel, but breakfast was fine (except for the coffee, which hotels rarely seem to get right for breakfasts). Unfortunately wifi was only free to some hotel guests, if Reward Club members, and not free in any public areas or to conference delegates, and we did receive some complaints about this. Overall a good place to visit."	Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to provide us with some excellent customer feedback. I am delighted to read that in the main you enjoyed your stay with us. With regards to the WIFI, our WIFI is free to all guests if they are staying in the hotel, however it is not included for all conference delegates. Thank you for choosing Crowne Plaza Leeds as your preferred hotel of choice and may I thank you again for your recommendation to future potential guests. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Crowne Plaza Leeds very soon. Kind Regards Marco Frik General Manager	4	7 May 2015	N/A
I was in Indianapolis for a conference in March 2015 (sorry..this review is a bit late). The staff at the hotel were excellent and very friendly. It appeared that the rooms were recently updated in the last several months with new kitchen countertops, carpet, furniture, and paint (since this was a Residence Inn, I was given a room with a living area and a bedroom.) The kitchen appliances were a bit dated but worked well. The one thing that I did find odd was that when I went to place things in the cabinet under the bathroom sink, it appeared that the sink was being held up by a board (not a big problem since I put my stuff elsewhere). The breakfast was good (I did not try the evening reception). The pool was great and I enjoyed the workout gym. My only complaint was the the hotel had poor wifi reception...I either could not log on or it kept kicking me off. The staff stated that they were having problems with the cable company and were trying to fix it. For those who are staying for a conference in the city, I would recommend the hotel.	Hello, thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We certainly appreciate it. I apologize about the unpleasant stay. I can absolutely agree that there were missed opportunities with your stay that could have been handled differently. Either way, you are welcome to get in touch with me at the hotel so we can further discuss this matter. Thank you!	3	July 26, 2015	July 27, 2015
We stayed for 2 nights bed and breakfast and evening meal, from the moment we went into hotel the staff couldn't have been more helpful without being over the top. From the receptionist to waitresses and bar staff they made the hotel such an enjoyable place to be.The hotel was exceptionally clean and rooms were basic but this suited our needs as we used the hotel as a base for shopping etc. Great location, congratulations to all staff we had dealings with, a great team spirit .thank you , we will definitely be back can't wait for another excuse to get back here.	Dear Suzannahonneill, Thank you for reviewing your stay. I'm delighted you enjoyed your stay with us and I hope I can welcome you back to the hotel and Belfast's shops soon! Kind regards, Jonathan Topping	5	29 December 2011	N/A
I usually always try and pick HI express as you get a fairly consistent standard and the breakfast is always included. The downside to this particular hotel were its lack of car park, which ends up costing £8 per night at the adjacent multi storey which makes the cost of a nightly stay fairly expensive for what is a busy and basic hotel. However on the plus side the location is excellent for city centre activities and you have a number of restaurants on the doorstep of the hotel, we tried Mumtaz indian restaurant which was superb. The hotel was full to capacity during our stay but i slept well and was not disturbed by noise inside or outside, the only draback being at breakfast time when there were simply too many people trying to eat at the same time and not enough staff keeping things stocked.	Dear angiebeno, Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us your feedback. Your comments are highly valuable to us and will assist us in our continuous efforts to maintain and improve the service level we aim for. I am pleased to know that you had a satisfactory stay at our hotel. I appreciate feedback that we receive, whether positive and negative to ensure we provide the best level of service and facilities that we can give to our guests. Thank you again for your review and I hope to have an opportunity of welcoming you back again soon. Sincerely, Krysllin G. Case Manager IHGCare	3	4 February 2013	N/A
The classiest place I have ever stayed at. They had a party on New Year's Day. The staff was so friendly, and the lodge I stayed in was the best of the best. That is the only place I want to stay when I come back to Denver.	How lovely!!! Thank you for such a wonderful review. On behalf of my family, thank you very much for staying with us. It was a great party wasn't it? We look forward to having you back anytime! Melissa	5	January 4, 2018	January 5, 2018
I had been to Pethers before and loved it! However, return visit for 2 nights was not as expected. Arrived at 6pm to an envelope with my name scrawled on it sitting on front desk with keys, letter and map to the cabin inside. Found our way to the cabin (beautiful just as remembered), however the cheese platter was not there as ordered (and not mentioned in the letter). Rang phone number and told I was a late arrival and to go to the restaurant to pick up the cheese platter. There was a dog barking for some of the time, but the main disappointment was on the Friday night with a disco thumping next door. The room and the location and rainforest feel was still magical and lovely, but the lack of greeting on arrival, and the dog and disco noise were really disappointing.	Thank you for taking the time to review Pethers. Standard check-in time is from 2pm, with our reception staffed until 5pm every evening. Standard practice is to contact late arrivals, which we did without success, and provide an arrival letter, keys and directions to the tree house. Due to the boutique nature of our business, it is not viable to have reception manned 24 hours a day, however we do offer a 24 hour staff contact service. I apologise that your cheese platter was not in your room on arrival, as expected. Unfortunately the noises emanating from beyond the boundaries of our property are not within our control. We thank you for your review. All guest comments assist us in improving customer service and guest experiences.	2	14 March 2017	N/A

Dear grainne_donald, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your recent stay.

Very friendly and helpful staff. Good size rooms with very comfortable bed. Have stayed here several times. Can definitely recommend the Capricornia Restaurant right next door for dinner but breakfast was overrated and expensive.	Dear Cherie, thank you for your positive comments. I am so glad to hear that we could be helpful for you and that you enjoyed your stay with us again! We hope to see you back soon!	4	4 June 2016	6 June 2016
Had a great experience with staff members, check in, check out. I changed rooms mid stay with no problems doing so. Would definitely stay again and recommend to my friends and family. Mist enjoyable stay.	Hi Steven, Thank you so much for your feedback and we appreciate the time you have taken to highlight that when you made changes that you had no problems with this at all. We are so pleased to read that you would definitely recommend our property to friends and family as that is what helps our business be sustainable is by clients coming back and bringing their friends and family with them. Have a great day and look forward to welcoming you, your family and friends back to the property in the future. Kind Regards Russell Owner Quest in Mackay	5	17 June 2016	21 June 2016
	Someone kindly advised me of this review which is totally unfounded and over reactive. My apartments sleep either one group of 8 or two groups of 4 people. The smaller apartment has a staircase leading down to the garden door and storage rooms below for maintenance, garden machinery and one room that a sound engineer uses for storing his equipment. This engineer works in the studio and does not live there, he has a key to the garden door as do the cleaning staff, gardener, my husband and myself - so several people have access. The door to the ground floor longe has a lock and key as does the bedrooms off the first floor landing. The situation is very similar to that of many Guest house and Hotels, staff have keys and so do you. If you rent a Villa abroad the garden boy will arrive unannounced as will the maids to do the cleaning! Whilst being very aware of security issues particularly regarding children would these people seriously leave very young children unattended any where in a strange place. I would certainly never let me apartments to families and put them in any situation I consider dangerous. I always point out the fact that we have a river close by and balconies which children might climb on, I also have strict health and safety conditions regarding use of the Hot Tub . I was not pleased to find that these guests had piled all our garden furniture up and barracaded the staircase causing a fire escape to be blocked. When the guest complained i dealt with it in a polite way and suggested that if he was dissatisfied I would happily refund his money and they could leave the following day. The comment about Ikea was very unnecessary as I'm sure all Ikea fans will agree!! I have a mixture of Laura Ashley, Sofa workshop, Cargo and yes Ikea - most people comment on how nicely the apartments are furnished. The recording studio aspect is neither here nor there as it is lead lined and separate from the accommodation. Most guests are really interested in the fact that Robert Plant, Marty Wild, Goldfrapp to name a few might be their close neighbours!	1	5 February 2007	N/A
This hotel has the perfect location, and is walking distance from all the good shopping areas and restaurants. Hokulani checked us in and was very warm and welcoming. All the staff who work at this hotel are so friendly as well. This hotel is great for couples and big families. You should definitely book this hotel, you won’t regret it	Aloha, Raechal! Although we may have a peerless location in the heart of Waikiki, we have long believed that it is the genuine hospitality provided by our Laylow team members which brings guests back through our doors time and time again. And while you did find our address a “perfect location” for all of the local attractions including the beach only a few blocks away, it is quite evident that your designation of us as the “Best Hotel” has even more to do with the interactions you had with our entire staff. We especially appreciate you recognizing Hokulani, whose normal bright smile was absolutely beaming upon learning of your special shout-out. Your five-star recommendation of us to future travelers means the world to us and we can’t wait to welcome you back on your next visit to Honolulu! Mahalo nui loa, Robert C. Friedl General Manager	5	January 14, 2020	N/A
We stayed here overnight as a break in the journey from Sydney to Vancouver. Free shuttle service from airport to hotel and room was good size and clean. We ate at sister hotel next door (courtesy of another shuttle) as the restaurant wasn't open on the night we were there. Pool area very inviting and all in all a good place to stay. The staff were extremelyhelpful and friendly.	Aloha and mahalo for your positive review. We are glad that you had the time to enjoy our newly renovated outdoor pool and took advanatge of our complimentary airport shutlle service. Our staff pride themeselves on sharing their sincere Aloha Spirit with our visitors to the island and we are glad you experienced that during your stay with us. We hope you will return to our beautiful island again. The AUS dollar is still very strong so that's another bonus reason to come back and visit us. Cheers and Aloha,	5	September 19, 2012	N/A
A brilliant stay was had by my wife and i in this excellent city hotel check-in was very quick and nothing was a bother for any of the staff during our stay the hotel was very busy however did not feeol overcrowded.

The Maids Head Hotel is one of the oldest in the country. The junior suites were, however, very modern and a delight with everything you need and an ipad to explore the hotel and to control the room heating. The team at the hotel were excellent from the first greeting through to the checkout. The food was well prepared and presented and all of the folks you meet have one goal in mind - you must enjoy yourself. The hotel is well placed for the Cathedral(s) the river walks and the shopping centre. If you want a few days away this could be the place for you.	Dear Dinoetech, Great to read that you had a lovely stay and were so well looked after. We work hard to make sure we have the right team in place so it is always a pleasure to read that we have succeeded for you. Don't forget our return stay offer for your next visit. Kind regards Andrew S Operations manager	5	7 November 2017	11 November 2017
We had a wonderful time during our stay at the Best Western PLUS Peak Vista Inn & Suites while vacationing in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The room was large and laid out well. It had a great TV with wonderful reception. Our bathrooms shower head was awesome, it was like a rain shower. Our breakfast was always tasty and hot. The staff was very helpful and knowledgable in reguards to the area and where we could find things, even printing out directions. The pool and hot tub were very nice, and even had a lovely little patio where you could sun bathe. They had a very nice excercise room as well. We loved the staff.	Dear Cindilee, Thank you for taking the time to review us on Tripadvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay with us. I will pass along your comments to our staff, they work hard to make every guest feel at home.

Stayed at the Woodstock for a weekend trip. Had a wonderful time! Service was exceptional, owners were very friendly and welcoming. James went out of his way to make our weekend stay very enjoyable. He was extremely helpful, hardworking and very friendly. The same can be said for Tommy. The room was great, and the food was exquisite. Would definitely recommend this hotel!	Dear Geraldine, Thank you for review of your stay in Hotel Woodstock. I am delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us at hotel Woodstock, and especially that you found the room to be great and that our staff were so accommodating during your time with us. It was wonderful to read that you found James and Tommy to have worked so hard to make your stay with us that bit more special. This is something that we encourage all of our staff members to do and I will make sure to personal pass on your kind words to the two young gentlemen. I look forward to welcoming you upon your next visit with us at Hotel Woodstock. Kind regards, Sean Lally Owner/General Manager	5	19 February 2017	N/A
I found Wellington Travel Lodge to be in a fantastic location and excellent staff :) Every interaction with staff was very professional. The room was of excellent value and everyday the friendly cleaners did a very good job. Highly recommend if you need to stay in central Wellington.	Dear hthomas209 Thank you for sharing your excellent comments and rating with us. I am delighted to know that you had a great stay with us and were well looked after by our friendly team. Our Hotel's culture is to go over and beyond for our guest and it is clearly reflected with your feedback. Being in center city is a definite bonus as it allows all our guests to take in the sights and sounds of Wellington CBD. I will share your feedback with the team as I am certain this will act as encouragement to all of them. Thank you once again. I look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Regards, Daron Pereira Hotel Manager	4	24 July 2016	14 August 2016
Great views from the room. However the rooms are very dated and no sound proofing. We were watching TV at sound volume 9 out of 35 and both our neighbours asked us to turn it down as they couldn’t hear their own TV. The Alpine restaurant upstairs is also appalling, avoid.	Dear RagsCity, We thank you for bringing this to our attention and are sorry to hear we have not met your expectations on this occasion. We encourage our guests to share such concerns directly with us so we can resolve them immediately and ensure everyone's comfort. Kind regards, Agathe Audrain Front Office Manager	2	28 October 2018	N/A
We stayed in a basic cabin for one night on our journey north. The cabin was clean, although one of the beds had clean, but stained sheets, and the back of the curtains were rather dirty. Everything else was clean. The laundry facilities were good. We were able to get all our clothes washed and dried easily. Our cabin was quiet as it was towards the back of the park. The front of the part would be noisier as it is on the highway. I would definitely recommend this place for a stopover, and would be happy to return.	We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Southside Holiday Village. It is excellent to hear that you were happy with our facilities and services. Our laundry is outsourced so please next time if you have any issues with the linen let us know ASAP so we can address it with our laundry. We look forward to seeing you again.	4	29 June 2016	30 June 2016
Stayed 1 night here, great location close to city, approx 10 min drive. Also close to airport & situated right next to the river. Spacious apartment, very clean & modern. The outside table & chairs to sit & overlook the river. Full kitchen gives you option to cook.	Dear Louise, Thank you for your review and feedback. I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and found our hotel worthy of your kind words. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.	4	5 October 2014	N/A
Yet again Meriton is fantastic. These apartments are super clean, spacious and incredibly comfortable. Customer service is amazing (which you don't see very often) and the rooms are truly beautiful. Close to Roma Street station or easy for a taxi to drop you off. Views are amazing and easy walking distance to all the attractions that Brisbane had to offer. Easy walk for those wanting to go to Southbank.	Dear outbackislandgirl, Thank you for your post regarding your recent stay with Meriton Serviced Apartments on Herschel St. Wow! what a fantastic review. It is so pleasing to read that you had a fantastic stay and you were able to enjoy our clean, spacious and comfortable rooms. The team at the front desk will be thrilled to read your comments on their level of customer service, both the reception and housekeeping teams take great pride in delivering a quality service to all of our guests. It's great that you were able to take in the amazing views available from your apartment and that you found our location central to all the attractions Brisbane has to offer. We look forward to welcoming you back next time you are in Brisbane. Kind Regards Meriton Management	5	21 May 2014	7 June 2014
	Thank you for sharing your review with us. It does please us to know that you experienced a smooth check in with our lovely front desk staff. It is, however, disappointing to find that you experienced a “musty” smell inside of your unit and that our beds did not meet your comfort. Our pools are cleaned regularly and unfortunately, we are unable to do our cleaning procedures when guests are in the pools. We do have specific times throughout the year where our maintenance staff takes the necessary steps in ensuring that our amenities are in good condition. We also want you to know that our timeshare presentations are purely voluntary and we do require our guests to meet specific qualifications in order to complete the tour and incentives offered. We do apologize for any inconveniences you may have faced due to not being qualified for any given reason. Wi-Fi and our resort activities do come at an additional cost and these options can be added to your stay when you check in. We do hope to have another opportunity to exceed your expectations in the future. Luna	2	July 26, 2015	September 9, 2015
I confess I don't have a good brand memory of Holiday Inn hotels generally. But this was close to the airport and a good price. I will come back here! This hotel was modern, the staff was super nice. The rooms were new and dark and quiet. Free shuttle to the airport was excellent. My only advice would be to have dinner somewhere else, even the airport might be better. The service was nice but that was about it. No decor and the food was meh.	Dear Bartleymon, We appreciate your four star review and the time that you have taken to share your experience with us! Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of our company. I am very sorry to learn that your experience in the restaurant, was less than adequate. I will make sure this is addressed. Thank you for being a valued guest of the Holiday Inn Charlotte-Airport and for your business. We look forward to your next stay!	4	October 17, 2016	October 22, 2016
Staying at the hotel we thought on a Saturday night we would have some drinks. Not impressed at all. I had to ask numerous times for menus, we were squashed into a corner, I asked for a better seat rather than a dumpy stool (I’m 6ft 2) was told none available, when I pointed a seat that was holding jackets it was ignored. Prosecco came flat in which waitress / manager agreed and changed. Overall all for a high end place, service and product quite poor, wouldn’t rush back. Went to anchor line which was great.	Dear Scottishlad31 Thank you for bringing this feedback to my attention. I am sorry to hear that we did not live up to your expectations on this occasion. Whilst negative feedback is never pleasing to read, it is vital for us to listen and react to comments that will help us improve. We actively encourage feedback as we pride ourselves on providing the best guest experience that we can with quality of ingredient and efficient delivery which we seem to have been ill prepared for on this occasion, which is so unlike us and for which I apologise. Arriving in any bar and having to request drink menus multiple times is simply unacceptable and I apologise wholeheartedly for this. Since your review we have reprinted another set of menus in order to prevent this situation from arising again. At the point of time when your group joined us, we were extremely busy and were unable to arrange a larger table to accommodate you all, I appreciate that this was not an ideal situation. I realise that your perception of us will not the best based on this experience, but would urge you to return in order for us to show you that guest experience really is at the heart of everything we do, and I would be obliged if you would contact me directly when returning in order for me to personally reserve a table for your enjoyment. Kind regards, Rhuaridh Paul Bar Manager rp@dakotaglasgow.co.uk	2	18 September 2018	N/A
	Sounds like you had a great time and we love to hear all the great feedback. Customer service and comfortable clean accommodation is what we aim for. The Retreat is close enough to everything to be convenient but far enough away to feel like you are in the middle of now where. Quiet and peaceful is how we best describe the park. Hope to see you again :) 	5	3 June 2018	5 August 2018
We had a great stay hete. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Breakfast included was good every morning. The room wad small but clean and tidy and the bed large and comfy. They gave us a cell phone for the duration of our stay and we could call family in Canada any time. It was also great for internet use when out and about. We will definitely stay here again.	Dear nsjetsetters, Thank you for writing a review of the Park Grand Kensington.

"The architecture of the building is amazing. When you walk in, you are immediately surrounded by the feeling of success and luxury. The hotel, casino, and restaurants are all extremely well kept and inviting. The Valet and Bell Hop Services are extremely polite, helpful, and welcoming. The suite I stayed in had an amazing view and I felt as if I was at home. I had the feeling of ""I've made it!"" The Palazzo is an excellent hotel in every way and actually very reasonably priced. It is mandatory to stay here for a full Vegas Luxury experience."	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your positive experience. There is no greater satisfaction, as a customer service professional, than receiving kind words from a valued guest. Rest assured that your comments have been shared with our team members. They will truly appreciate hearing from satisfied guests like you. Every aspect of The Venetian | The Palazzo was created for the enjoyment of our guests; from our luxurious suites and beautifully re-created historic landmarks of Venice, Italy, to hand-painted frescos and world-class restaurants. I am so very pleased to hear that you had such a memorable and enjoyable stay. I value your patronage and certainly hope to host you again so that we may continue to amaze you with our Unmatched Service Standards.

A good hotel for the price. Rooms were very clean and the hotel had a nice indoor swimming pool. The breakfast was outstanding, especially with the omelettes. I will stay there next time I'm in Indy. Also restaurants are within walking distance.	We appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your experience at the hotel. It is always nice to hear that our guests enjoyed their time with us and that the service exceeded your expectations.

A must stay and do for anyone exploring the east Macdonnell ranges. Wonderful sights and a geologists dream. The Pool was cleaned while we there and just what ne needs to cool off when in high 30's. The drive around the property and then 70 kms to Althunga heritage gold areas was also special.	It is a great place to base yourself to see the East Mac Donnell ranges and if you have a 4 WD you can definately spend an easy 3 days out here. I marvel on a daily basis how our predecessors were so tough and resilient to come through this area and do what they did!	4	23 April 2016	N/A
We loved this hotel. In a perfect location with beautiful sea views. Bedroom also had great views and was clean and well equipped. Lovely indoor pool plus great grounds and out door pool for the summer. Also had lunch and coffees here when staying near by. Quite pricey in high season	Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We are delighted to read you enjoyed our location and the sea view our rooms offer. Thank you for also visiting the hotel as a non-resident for lunch and coffee. We hope to see you again at the Watersmeet.	4	25 August 2017	N/A
What sets the standard apart is it’s smart and sexy design elements combined with its hip crowd. If your looking for a sexy, fun and unique place to stay in NYC, the standard is near the top of my list. A helpful tip is to get one of the premium rooms with an oversized bubble bath tub as it’s great to relax in after a long day!	Hi akalfayan, Thank you for taking the time out to share your experience with us, glad that you had a pleasant stay with us. We hope to host you again.	5	May 8, 2018	N/A
I can’t say enough about this hotel It’s phenomenal - truly. I’ve stayed here twice in the last two weeks and I love it. The staff is amazing There are free lattes and wine in the morning and night And it’s clean!!!	Dear E6126SNcourtneyb, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience! We are thrilled to have you as our guest, and absolutely adore you and your family. Thank you for choosing to stay with us, and being a part of our Halcyon family.

Excellent location, walking distance from almost everything. There are pubs and bars really close and the bus station is 5 min walk away. Clean and friendly. Titanic experience is a 25-30 min walk but it's worth to look around the city!	Hello Patty J, Thanks ever so much for your nice comment! I will definitely share with my team. :) We are looking forward seeing you again so please let us know when you are back to Belfast. Warm regards Tamas Balogh Assistant General Manager	4	2 May 2018	N/A
I usually stay at this hotel when visiting Glasgow and whilst I appreciated things have improved since my last visit there are still a few areas of opportunity. The access as a pedestrian is much improved wanting to walk into the city centre as there are now steps across the road from the main entrance therefore no need to make your way down a dark poorly lit lane that was previously the case. Whilst the reception staff were polite and friendly it now seems impossible to be upgraded to an executive room if you are a Gold Hilton Honours member. This will be the fourth occasion in a row I have been denied this and yet there seemed to be rooms available. I checked the option online to pay extra for the upgrade but it never seems to be offered at this hotel. The room we had however was spacious and clean and reasonable good value.	Dear grascots, Thank you for returning to stay with us on your recent visit to Glasgow. I am glad to hear that you are happy that the pedestrian access to the hotel has improved since your last visit with us, with the opening of the St Vincent Plaza’s Public Realm and you no longer need to access the hotel through a poorly lit lane. However, I am sorry to hear that whilst the reception staff are polite and friendly it always seems to be impossible to upgrade to an executive room with your Gold Hilton Hhonors membership. I apologise for this and will make sure to pass these comments on to the front office management team. Thank you for sharing! Kind Regards, Daniel van Wyk Hotel Manager	3	30 December 2015	5 January 2016
The holiday inn Denver east-stapleton was a clean and comfortable hotel for our stay in Denver. Initially we were to use this hotel only as a stop over however we decided to stay a 2nd night seeing as the hotel was clean and well located for our needs. The hotel itself has a nice indoor concept where the rooms all have doors facing an interior court yard. Both the rooms we had at this hotel were comfortable and modern looking. They both had a quick internet connection, good air conditioning and a flat screen tv with good reception. The exterior parking lot was small and packed when we arrived but fear not as there is a mostly empty interior parking lot available in the adjacent building, a small walk is needed to get to the hotel but it wasn't long enough to cause us any discomfort and it was indoors. The staff at the hotel were very nice as the price had jumped up for our second night since availability was low however the lady at the counter was nice enough to get us a very good deal. There are lots of restaurants available across the street. My personal suggestion, go to Smash Burger, they offer a really tasty burger! There are also stores like Walmart if ever you need anything else. All in all we had a good stay at this hotel and would recommend it.	Thank you for taking your time and writing such a wonderful review about our hotel. We are especially glad to hear the compliments on your experience with our guestrooms and staff! It's so great to hear that you were able to enjoy all that the Stapleton area has to offer as well. We hope you will visit us in the future so we can welcome you back to our property. We truly appreciate your business and hope to see you again soon. Warm Regards, Amber Mansfield	4	August 18, 2012	August 20, 2012
Excellent manager who did everything To arrange the problem of our reservation Found a room in another hotel for us Offered the taxi and dinner So we décided to come two others nights in this hotel because of the Perfect attitude of the manager Who can Cope with many langages.

Very friendly staff. The breakfast is very good. Very close to most attractions. The indoor pool is very spacious. The staff was very helpful with any questions or issues. Free parking and plenty of spaces to park. Lots of luggage carts so there is never a shortage.

I stayed at the Gladstone Central Plaza Apartments for two nights - August 2018. The lounge and kitchen were much larger than expected with a large balcony. The kitchen was fully equipped and included a coffee machine and laundry in the cupboard. The free wifi was worked well and there was a desk with powerpoint. My room was clean and well maintained. The hotel is only a short work to the GECC and main street. For the size and location it was reasonably priced.	Afternoon, Thank you for your positive review and I am glad you enjoyed your stay. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit.	4	2 September 2018	4 September 2018
A beautiful place very relaxing the staff were excellent and the rooms were lovely dinner in the restaurant was very good and so was our breakfast I was a little disappointed with the massage I received was not the full hour	Hello felixandpaulines, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Tripadvisor. I am so happy you enjoyed fantastic service and had a great experience in Katers. I am sorry you were disappointed with the massage, I will pass this feedback on to the spa provider. Regards, Jesse Kornoff General Manager	4	29 September 2016	30 September 2016
Almost all rooms face into inner courtyard areas. They are all away from lifts. Very soft beds. Warm rooms so humming aircon keeps you awake. Lovely bathrooms and wet area shower but water comes out all over the floor, not ideal. Torrid night's sleep on soft bed. Stayed out of necessity due to late arrival. Convenient in winter when flights are early or late arrival. Expensive.	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with the Trip Advisor community, First and foremost please accept my sincere apologies as I was disappointed to read about your experience on your last visit. We strive to deliver a high level of service throughout all our outlets and do our utmost to provide a luxury experience to each and every guest. I am disappointed to know that you haven’t experienced our usual standard of service on your last stay and I would like to assure you that we have taken your feedback seriously in order to take the appropriate measures and make improvements.

Fantastic setting, staff and atmosphere, the best crab sandwich lunch ever !! Great day great pub, sat outside for an hour watching the world go by with a pint of stag ale, then inside for lunch , it was that popular couldn't get a table for dinner later, but next time for sure	We would always recommending pre booking a table in our restaurant as we do get busy, we serve the same menu in our bar area but don't take bookings,as long as our staff now you would like to eat they will endeavor to seat you as soon as they can,this can incur a wait.Fantastic staff and atmosphere and the best crab lunch ever! What brilliant comments,thank you , these have been passed on and were much appreciated by all.We look forward to welcoming you back to The Rising Sun next time you are in the area.	4	11 August 2016	N/A
Very nice hotel great spa and indoor pool food could be better breakfasts was passable ,charged extra for a latte coffee .Room was fine .Main restaurant was closed for a function no one told us until we arrived we ate in the terrace restaurant service ok but food lacked lusture	Dear Barrie Thank you for your review. I am very glad to see that you liked your room and our spa. I am sorry that you found dinner in the Terrace a little disappointing and I have passed on your comments. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I hope that if you choose to stay here again you will have a better dining experience. Kind regards Wyn	3	15 November 2016	N/A
We stayed as part of a coach group for two night's while visiting Norwich and going to Thursford. The hotel is clean and comfortable and is a budget hotel but worth the money and if you want better facilities be prepared to pay higher rates. We have used this hotel several times because it is in a location which is ideal for our tour and because it is competitive with rates. I have always found that a major asset is the staff who are friendly, efficient and helpful which is a credit to them, Tom and Ben dealt with our group on this occasion and as usual did everything we asked for without hesitation.	Dear Frank B, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and for your repeat custom with us. I would like to personally thank you for your recognition towards myself and Tom. We strive to ensure we offer our guests a high level of customer service and it is a pleasure to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. I do hope we can continue to welcome you back in the future and hope to see you again soon. Best Regards, Ben Sayer Guest Service Manager	4	2 December 2013	N/A
This is an excellent hotel, with comfortable rooms, great breakfast, and a convenient gym. The staff were exceptionally helpful and welcoming, made our weekend in London amazing. Thank you Alex, Camy, and Gafala, for making our anniversary trip so fun!	Dear keren888, Thank you very much for having taken some of your precious time to share this fabulous review on Tripadvisor following your recent stay with us at Park Grand Kensington. I am absolutely thrilled to see that you had such a wonderful breakfast experience, and our well appointed rooms was up to your liking. Its a pleasure to know that Alex, Camy and Gazala created memories for on your anniversary stay. I hope to have the pleasure of personally welcoming you back in the not too distant future Kind Regards, Arpan Ghosh	5	4 August 2018	N/A
This hotel was ok... nothing fancy. Admittedly we like nice/newer hotels to stay in, so my opinion may be biased, but this one could really use some updating. Our room was fine and clean, the whole hotel is just really quite old and a dingy. We stayed here before a local race so we were not here for the amenities, just a place to sleep. We also got a group discount which made staying here worthwhile, but there is no way I would pay full price for what this hotel offers.	Thank you Katelyn. Your feedback is of utmost importance to our continued improvement and success. Your comments have been shared with the entire Ambassador team. It is through comments such as yours that we are able to constantly update/change our facilities and services for the better so you can enjoy the hospitality that you have come to expect. I hope you will give us the opportunity to welcome you back to the Ambassador. I would love to personally arrange your next visit. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Stayed here one night after our trip along the GOR ,before flying up to Caines the next day.Not sure if i would have given it 4* more like 3*,this is the second Best Western Hotel we have stayed at, that was suppose to be 4* and more like 3*, they seem to be rather dated. It was clean and quite a large room but nothing special.Didn't get mush sleep as there we people outside our room making a lot of noise at 2am.	First of all Thanks for your time to give us a review. Our Renovation Project is undergoing for a while, we have done 25 rooms already and the block you stayed will be renovated in 3 month time. Best western international will divided into 3 brands at end of the year. They will be Best western, Best western plus and Best western Premier. Hopefully this will help you to find the accommodation that suits your needs easier. Most likely we will be a Best western Plus at end of the year. Please visit us again and let's service you with the changes. We value your opinion.	3	21 May 2011	N/A
What a mess.. spending huge money on a 5 star resort only to spend the day banging around with the masses in the park. Personally - one day in the park and three days at the resort next time... no need to be subjected to the masses when there is so much to do on the property. Property is a bit far out it requires at $30 ride to any park entrance. Rooms are nice but showing wear. Staff worked really hard to make our daughters Christmas a happy one - thank you!	Thank you so much for taking the time to provide us with your thoughts regarding your recent stay at the resort! I just wanted to be sure you were aware of the complimentary motor coach transportation provided to the Parks (to avoid the car service fee). I hope to welcome you back again in the future. Kind regards, Charles Fisher, Resort Manager	5	December 28, 2018	N/A
A difficult one to review this as the hotel suffers from the excessive pricing that is brighton. This hotel can cost £40 or it can cost £100+. I try to review everything based on my expectations for the money paid. If this had been a £40 day then it would have been 5 *. For the higher price I paid then it is excessive. Anyway - the hotel is nice and clean. The lift should probably have been replaced in the 1970s but mostly it is great. The room was clean and nice but tiny - just enough room for the bed! Breakfast was cooked fresh and delicious. All staff were charming and helpful. So here is the quandry. It really should be higher but charging what you charge its over average BUT this is normal for brighton so honestly, this is better than brighton average!	Thank you for your constructive review Ian. I was pleased to read that the hotel was nice and clean and that you enjoyed the breakfast. The lift is fully serviced and in good working order. Thank you for your comments about the staff being charming and helpful. It was pleasing to read that you understand about the pricing in Brighton, although we are always very competitive with all other hotels in Brighton. If you are ever in Brighton in the future please contact us direct on 01273 820854 so that we can allocate you a larger room. Kind regards Shaun Donachie Operations Manager	3	23 March 2015	2 April 2015
We stayed in one of the 3 bedroom suites and it was very clean, spacious and had all the amenities to live and cook for one self. Walking distance to downtown Canmore and only 20 minutes to Banff. Only issue was the darn trains zipping by at all hours of the night right outside the bedroom window!	Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. We are thrilled to hear you found the unit to be clean and well equipped, and it's great to hear you liked our central location! Unfortunately the historic CP trainline does run throughout the centre of Canmore, so to be within close walking distance to downtown also means to be close to the tracks. We do have units away from the track side, and would have loved to have found a unit which better suited your needs. We hope you will give us another chance next time!	3	November 6, 2018	N/A
We stayed in a one bedroom villa at Moama on Murray, fantastic little spot. It isn't walking distance from town so you won't be able to walk in to dinner for example, however it is quite peaceful which is great if you are looking for a relaxing getaway. Great for families as it looked to have a fun kids club, pool area and mini golf! I would probably suggest the accommodation is upscale caravan park cabin style, it definitely reminded me of cabins we have stayed in before as it has that laid back comfortable feel but in saying that, cabins inside are lovely and clean and have the biggest bath it was great! One of the best things is how there are ducks and other animals walking around outside the cabins, I loved that! Great place to stay in summer too to get the most use of the facilities. A suggestion would be to make our stay more comfortable more towels would have been great and please, just a little bit more milk!	Thank you for taking the time to review our property. The resort is located a couple of kilometers from town which gives it that secluded peaceful atmosphere. We are fortunate to have many of the clubs and pubs in town offering complimentary courtesy buses for our guests so they can enjoy a meal in town and not have to drive in. Our one bedroom villas are only 2 years old and have been designed to provide guests with ample space - the bathrooms in particular all have large luxurious style baths or spa baths so guests can relax in comfort. We hope we are able to welcome you back again and let us know if you need anything further during your stay as our staff a happy to accommodate.	4	28 July 2013	N/A
For £50 as part of a last minute booking I got a large double room (upgraded from a small double as they'd none left). It was spacious, the bed was clean and comfortable. The wifi worked, the TV was a nice big flatscreen. The lighting in the room was bright. Shower was good. So why not five stars? I walked in with a work colleague and the hotel receptionist assumed we were staying together. I was not amused.	Dear Dave S, Thank you so much for your lovely review, That's great to hear you were selected for a complimentary upgrade to a large double room, and found the room spacious, clean and comfortable! I'm also very pleased to hear you were impressed with our Wi-Fi, the bright lighting and modern refurbished bathroom! And that you enjoyed our new large flat screen TV - Now fitted in all our hotel rooms! I apologise for the assumption our receptionist made regarding your colleague. The team works very hard to ensure five star service at all times and your feedback is very important to us. I hope to welcome you back to the hotel very soon. Warmest Regards, Jonathan & The Cairn Hotel Team	4	25 March 2015	N/A
I have recently stayed in The Connacht Hotel. It is a nice hotel with a good variety of things to do. With it being only a few minutes away from the City's Centre, a taxi was always there to take you in. The Rooms were nice and spacious. The hotels Overall Hygiene was excellent as well. Good Food and a recommended one for a nite or to away.	Dear Ronan, Thank you so much for your very positive feedback and for taking the time to write a review on Tripadvisor.

Stayed for one night in room 231 . We had booked the hotel for its location and the fact that holiday inn express are usually ok. This hotel is sadly let down by its housekeeping. We stayed in room 231 and what greeted us upon opening our door was an overwhelming smell of damp and the room was very cold. We turned up the heating but the damp smell was not great . I turned back the duvet cover to be greeted by a huge piece of chewing gum that had obviously been laundered to the fabric ( see attached photo ) we promptly turned it over !!! The carpet in the room was very badly stained and grubby but the worst thing ( which we did not see until the morning ) was that the net curtains were covered in mould !!!! all in all very poor which is such a shame as the rooms are a good size , the bathroom was very clean however the towels were a bit thread bare . Front desk service was good and the breakfast was fine . The receptionist was very apologetic when I gave her the chewing gum wrapped in a tissue that I had scraped off the duvet cover. Very poor standard of rooms and overall cleanliness .	Hello brentiesuk, Thank you for choosing the Holiday Inn Express Norwich, UK, and posting a review and rating your stay. I would like to apologize if your stay was less than satisfactory and that your expectations were not met as a result of cleanliness issues you raised in your assigned room.

Having never stayed at a Jurys Inn I wasn't sure what to expect but was very pleased with the room, service and staff. The location was perfect to explore the area and the staff was very helpful with directions and suggestions. I would definitely make Jurys Inn my home base for any future stays to the area and it provided incentive for me to try Jurys Inn at other locations!	Dear Bob H Thank you for your kind words and 5 star rating of our hotel. We pride ourselves in putting our guests first at all times and through friendly staff we ensure a warm welcome is extended to everyone. We are glad to hear you enjoyed our location and we provided everything you hoped for. We hope to welcome you back in the near future.

The overall experience has been underwhelming at this property, checked into a room a really noisy air conditioner, moved to a different room but had the same issue with the air conditioner, but we chose to not to move again because the location of the room was right in front of the pool which we liked, although swimming pool was not very clean. The sink in washroom smelled really bad. We had a really bad experience with burger theory restaurant, on the first day, there was only buffet option available contrary to the promised made to order breakfast, on the second day, we did get the made to order breakfast, and the server at the restaurant was really nice, on the third day, we were denied breakfast when we arrived 15 minutes before the closing time of 10 AM, when we requested for other options, we were handed over cereal to go, which was disappointing. When we informed at the front desk, we were told that they do acknowledge the issue and that we should have been served breakfast, and that management would be informed about this issue. We did find shuttle service to be convenient and available every time we made a request for it. Also, there was ample space for parking.	Saby173, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are deeply sorry to hear that your visit with us was underwhelming. This is most definitely not the experience we strive for for our guests. Please rest assured that this is not the norm at our hotel and we hope you will give us another chance the next time you are in Tampa so that we might have the chance to provide you with the level of service we are known for. Sarah Schmidt General Manager	2	March 9, 2019	March 11, 2019

We stayed at the ilikai for 2 nights. We were on the second floor newely renovated (same floor as the new pool). Not great for the view (we had partial ocean view) but everything else was awesome. Clean spacious room with everything you need (kitchenette). Nice walk to get to the beach which is butifull and clean. very familiy oriented with the lagoon. The nicest sunset i've seen.	Aloha didivac! Thank you very much for staying with us! I'm so glad you enjoyed our newly renovated units on the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor offers Luxury Junior Suites with a Boulevard View, Poolside View, Courtyard View or Partial Ocean View.

Very happy. Lovely hotel and room. Warm friendly service. Good food. What more can you ask for. The fires was my only issue. They weren't lit because they were going to be cleaned which didn't happen. Not sure why you wouldn't get the fires cleaned in summer rather than in autumn when guests would love to have them. Thankfully it wasn't too cold that weekend.	Dear 902alexanderj, We thank you for taking the time to review your most recent stay. It is meaningful to have the opportunity hear how the team contributed to a positive impression on your stay. Your constructive feedback has been well received. I hope the opportunity to stay with us again someday avails itself and we look forward to serving you once again. Kind Regards, Sukhjeev Kochar Front Office Manager	5	17 April 2017	14 May 2017
We stayed for 3 nights over Christmas. The room was a good size although a bit surprised to find a double and a single bed. Bathroom a bit dated, but clean and functional. Looked onto a bar, but everything closed down at 11pm so no problem there. We had the 3 course Christmas dinner which was good quality.	Hi travelaholic_8 Thank you for taking time to comment on your stay. So pleased you enjoyed your Christmas dinner, will pass your comment on to the chef. Kind regards, Lesley	4	26 December 2019	N/A
We were in Columbus for a trade show and came across this new hotel in the area that was offering a special price for their opening. The place was clean beyond belief! The only downside was that the pool wasn't ready to be open yet. So close to plenty of great shopping and just about any kind of food you could ask for.	Hi Marcy S, Thank you so much for your review! We are pleased to see that you enjoyed your stay with us. The Polaris location really is perfect for shopping and restaurants. We hope to see you again the next time you are in the area.

I stayed here recently for a business trip and it was amazing! From the second I arrived to the second I left, I felt like I was in the lap of luxury - completely unexpected. The hotel is an old bank that's been renovated. They've kept some of the details like then old vault doors and some of the tiles and it all adds to the charm of the place. I loved the open lobby and bar area, and the staff was very attentive. The room was appointed with the latest technology, plenty of outlets (even USB connections), great toiletries from Aveda, and a closet with shelving and tons of space. The bed and linens are new and the bathroom is spacious with a huge modern shower. Also - the gym is ridiculously modern with plenty of equipment, tons of cardio machines, and some free weights and other equipment. I'm a dedicated customer of a rival hotel chain, but this place made me think twice about that. Don't hesitate to stay here - it's comfortable, convenient, and the service is great.	Nicoleodeon, I'm glad that you took the time to post a wonderful review about your recent stay with us! I'm glad you were able to give our state of the art gym a try and got a good workout in. We hope you will choose to stay with us while traveling to Denver, and look forward to seeing you again!	5	November 2, 2014	N/A
Touring Ireland we stayed @ the Radisson for a Weekend (2/3 July) . The hotel has easy access by road &on site parking (mind the concrete walls) Most importantly its an easy short walk into the City centre with its endless supply of eateries & pubs!. The Business Class rooms & above offer the best view (if important ) over the inner Harbour & are worth the extra cost. We had wanted a balcony room but settled for business class when advised that the Balcony could not be used for safety reasons? The Service was great , the Beer was cold & the food very good. The open view Glass lift which runs from the underground garage to all of the floors is also great if you do not like confined spaces.	Dear Michael We are delighted you had a good stay with us in Galway. It is great that you enjoyed a business class room with a view and felt it was worth the supplement charge. We look forward to see you again in the near future. Best wishes Andrew Drysdale General Manager	5	12 July 2016	13 July 2016
Room a bit warn - bathroom needs more bench / storage space Shower very small Nice amenities breakfast options very substantial and staff very acocmodating to needs and changes.

Booked well in advance as I know this hotel gets busy from the reviews. And I’m glad we did it’s a very deceiving place You probably would walk straight past it and hardly notice it but from the second you walk through the door you know its going to be a great place to stay. Everything is to a high standard the staff are fantastic and can’t do enough for you the receptionist the waiters are all friendly and do a great job and obviously take pride in their work.

Beautiful accommodations - from the moment your arrive - the outside is well maintained and pleasing to the eye. the lobby is gorgeous - The beautiful water fountain in the center lobby tells you the type of hotel you're stepping into - luxury! The friendly staff (car/bell hop, receptionist) want to make your stay memorable.	Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind words and feedback!

Let me start with I am Hilton Diamond member and stay at their properties every week. For the most part, they are very nice properties with service and amenities that fall in line with similar chains. The Embassy Suites Hilton Brandon is unlike any other of the hotels I’ve stayed at in recent memory for one reason: The people. I was greeted, checked in and walked to the elevator by Zach at the reception desk. I noticed the way I was received immediately in the way he took extra care to make me feel welcome. That set the tone for the rest of the stay. The next morning I was immediately greeted by Annie and Diana who welcomed me to breakfast with a smile and warm greeting, not just the standard good morning. Chef Mike whipped me up an amazing omelet with a smile and the professionalism of executive chef. Again, it struck me how much each of these individuals cared and genuinely enjoyed what they were doing. Check out was just pleasurable as Allen repeatedly inquired as to how my stay was and genuinely asked me to return. People make the difference folks... These individuals made a weary business traveler feel like he was at 5 star resort with a private staff. Thank you to all for making this such an enjoyable experience.	Thank you so much for your recent 5 star stay! We really appreciate guest feedback and you mentioned all the aspects that we focus on for a great stay. It's all due to a great staff, that provide such well-maintained guest rooms and common areas, along with excellent guest service. We strive to have every guest leave as satisfied as you did. Once again, thanks for the great review and staying with us! We hope you will visit us again.	5	August 13, 2019	N/A

The Riviera Guest House was a great base for a romantic 2 night break. The views from room 2 were amazing and the actual room was the most comfortable we had stayed in for a long time. The only problem with bathroom was the fact that the bath narrowed down in the middle making it difficult to get two people in at the same time! I can't understand the comments about the small size of the cooked breakfast. It was plenty big enough for us, but like most of the guests staying at the same time we also had as much cereal and toast as we wanted. You couldn't find more friendlier hosts than Emma and Zed. We will be back!	Thank you VERY much for your positive review of your stay with us at the Riviera. It was really pleasing to read that we had met, if not exceeded, your expectations and it was very kind of you to take time out of your day to inform other guests of your experience. The guesthouse is very lucky to have such beautiful panoramic views for our guests to enjoy, we are so pleased you found them so romantic (we have to agree!!). I am also pleased you found Room 2 to be so comfy and found the atmosphere to be really friendly. We would like to thank you for your comments about the breakfast as we have trialled various sizes of breakfast over the past three years and believe we have found a size which suits most people (Bacon, Sausage, Hash Brown, Mushrooms, Beans, Tomoato and a choice of Egg). As you mention, guests can also help themself to as much cereal, toast, fruit and yoghurt as they would like. Some guests even have two Full English's so we'd like to think our guests go away with full tums! It was lovely to meet you both and are really looking forward to your stay with us again soon :-) Many thanks again :-)	5	8 April 2013	28 April 2013
I recently stayed here in a 2 bedroom suite. The suite was well designed and provided us with everything we need. All the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful. The hotel has a great waterfront location, within walking distance of many downtown attractions. I would certainly return.	Thank you for the great review Beachgoes. It's wonderful that you were able to stay in one of our two bedroom suites. They certainly are set up nicely for families! The proximity to downtown attractions is certainly an appealing feature for us. I have a feeling (judging by your username) that you are part of a family who enjoys a visit to the beach! I'm hoping you'll come back in the summer, that way, you can hitch a ride on the Wolf Island commuter ferry and pay a visit to Kingston's most popular beach! Thank you for staying and come back soon!	5	April 21, 2014	N/A
Boutique hotel seems to be a bit of a stretch for this property. That said however it is a very nice hotel (motel??). The rooms are contemporary, clean and comfortable. The property is only a short walk from the small business district. All in all a nice surprise and no complaints.	Thank you very much for providing us with such encouraging feedback. I am pleased you enjoyed our facilities and hopefully we will see you again in the not too distant future. Regards Christian	4	9 May 2015	N/A
Lovely room with comfy bed. Hotel appeared nice and clean. Only downside to lovely bathroom was lack of bath.....Only had walk in shower no good for those of us who like to soak in a bath, but not too much of a problem. Great location for travel by train as directly across road from station. Great breakfast served untill 11am on a Sunday	chardonnay2016 Thank you for your review! Really pleased you enjoyed your stay and I will be sure to share your feedback with the team! We look forward to welcoming you back soon! David Woodhouse Operations Manager	4	13 February 2017	N/A
We stayed 1st week August 2015, Room no.15,Average room size advertised as bigger, too close to the kitchen extractor, bed was 2 beds put together (but still comfy). Pool, sauna and steam room was very good, Bar could use a coat of paint on the ceiling. Pleasant staff - but no thanks/goodbye when we paid the bill when leaving.Breakfast was good and staff tried very hard to please everyone.We stayed at B W Weymouth last year , made this hotel only average	Thank you for your review Clive and I was sorry to note that we didn't tick all your boxes.

Prior to arrival, the owner Chris emailled to check about how we would like the rooms configured and as to dietary requirements etc which was a great start. On arrival we were warmly welcomed to a lovely little seperate apartment surrounded by fragrant gardens and in a quiet area of Cambridge. We appreciated the attention to detail, from the plethora of soft towels in the bathroom, to the wide variety of fresh condiments, to the detailed visitor booklet with information on absolutely everything in the area. There is a fan and heater to use if required as it has no air con, and a lovely outdoor spa in a private location. Beds were comfortable; large shower room, flat screen tv and plunger coffee. Breakfast was freshly baked delicious muffins which were a big hit with everyone (thank you Chris!), a generous supply of bread for toast as well as yoghurt and cereal choices. Muffins b&b is obviously run by someone who loves what she does and it really shows. We are international visitors but if back in the area we would not consider staying anywhere else.	Wow! Thank you for this review!	5	29 November 2013	N/A
This hotel does not meet Wyndham standards. It is in much need of repair and updating. If you are simply looking for a place near the airport to sleep and a cup of coffee in the morning it will suffice. The service was also very good.	We would like to offer our sincerest apologies for the issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. Thank you very much for bringing your concerns to our attention.	2	May 30, 2019	May 31, 2019
Great location, friendly staff, and newly reno-ed rooms. When I am in the area I always try to book this location. I stay in hotels about 10-12 nights a month so I certainly know what to expect, and this location meets and exceeds my expectations.	Thank you for taking the time to offer us a review Will. We appreciate you taking the time to express to the Trip Advisor community how much you enjoy our hotel. I have an excellent team here and I am pleased to hear they are meeting your needs. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit soon! Yours Truly, Jenni-lynn Hadley General Manager	5	June 9, 2017	June 13, 2017

Lovely spacious room with comfortable beds. Friendly helpful staff. Only small downside was musty smell to room which I think was contributed to by a shower curtain in bathroom that should be replaced.	Thank you for your review and feedback on your stay at the Ashling Hotel, Dublin. It was great to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. I was delighted to hear that you found your room so comfortable and our team to be friendly. I hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to us again in the future.

We stayed for 4 nights : 8th floor, panoramic views of Sydney Harbour. The 3 bdr suite is very large with many windows. It was sparkling clean. I like the location : many buses, train, Westfield. It's convenient to move around and easy to go shopping. You don't need a car.	Dear givilomitour, We are absolutely delighted that you enjoyed the spectacular harbour views that our suites have to offer. We couldn't agree with you more that our prime location makes shopping a breeze to get to! Thank you for sharing your feedback; a warm welcome awaits your return!
