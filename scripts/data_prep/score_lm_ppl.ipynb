With a nice mall across the street that too made for convenience. The room was quite nice with large towels, feather pillows and a comfortable mattress. Windows went from floor to ceiling though the veiws could be into someones office from the adjoining business center. I would definately stay here again when in Tampa.

Modern, comfortable, spotlessly clean rooms with an extra little luxury in the form of White Company cosmetics . Friendly staff, car parking and a quiet tranquil setting. I didn't eat there so can't comment on food, but the in room tea and coffee making facilities are top notch; including coffee bags and fresh milk ( stored in minibar) The best thing about the hotel is the location, just off Huntington Road, handy for A14 and A1. So no need to brave the one way system/ ring road. Perfect for access to Girton, Fitzwilliam, Churchill and Murray Edwards Colleges and very easy access to city centre via frequent buses or a pleasant 1.5 mile stroll.</td>\n",

I think a lot of time could be spent with this well-traveled couple as their stories were so entertaining! The house had the most amazing views from the deck. Our room did nt have a view but was spacious and comfortable. There was a great hike rup ght behnd the garage that led to probably the best view in all of Russell. Breakfast was on the deck — and that view again! The food was delicious and there was an abundance. Our last morning, we woke to a rainbow that we could see drom our bed. I could go on and on, but this is a “must”. Go to New Zealand, spend a few days i n russell and stay at Tiki Tiki Ora</td>\n",

       "      <td>Great Facility. Highly recommend ---SEP--- Four of us arrived tired after biking 50k of the Railtrail. The owner met us and we were efficiently installed into our pre booked rooms. The rooms were newly renovated, nicely appointed,and very roomy, with minimal modern furniture. Perfect. Our downstairs rooms opened onto a garden and large lawn, most unusual for a motel in a town, and a real gem. Although it’s close to the main road, and a little noisy outside, we really enjoyed sitting out there and even had our Thai delivered dinner there (very good food too) The garden is well below street level and so is actually quite protected from the road. Once in the room, with the doors closed, the rooms are well insulated and the road noise is minimal. I believe the owner hasn’t long been there, and we wish him every success. He was so friendly and helpful - couldn’t do enough to make our stay a pleasant one. Would go back here any day, and thoroughly recommend this motel.</td>\n",

Parking is free in the parking garage in the rear of the property with easy access to the lobby and room elevators. 9th floor pool offers some views and the pool area was nice but could see potential for crowding if hotel is full. With a nice mall across the street that too made for convenience. The room was quite nice with large towels, feather pillows and a comfortable mattress. Windows went from floor to ceiling though the veiws could be into someones office from the adjoining business center. I would definately stay here again when in Tampa. Felt very comfortable at this hotel and it's location.   \n",

The dinner and breakfast were excellent and precisely as we ordered. The rooms were warm and comfortable and quiet and we had a good nights sleep. The staff were welcoming, cheerful and competent.

Modern, comfortable, spotlessly clean rooms with an extra little luxury in the form of White Company cosmetics . Friendly staff, car parking and a quiet tranquil setting. I didn't eat there so can't comment on food, but the in room tea and coffee making facilities are top notch; including coffee bags and fresh milk ( stored in minibar) The best thing about the hotel is the location, just off Huntington Road, handy for A14 and A1. So no need to brave the one way system/ ring road. Perfect for access to Girton, Fitzwilliam, Churchill and Murray Edwards Colleges and very easy access to city centre via frequent buses or a pleasant 1.5 mile stroll.   \n",

I can't think of a better location from which to enjoy all that this great city has to offer. The rooms are very clean, the bed is extremely comfortable, the bathrooms offer plentiful and high quality products, and there are many thoughtful conveniences. The people who work at the hotel are friendly and helpful. We didn't have time to enjoy some of the property's amenities such as the lovely outside seating area and the pool, but they look very nice. I would definitely stay here again for any future visits to Halifax.   \n",

I think a lot of time could be spent with this well-traveled couple as their stories were so entertaining! The house had the most amazing views from the deck. Our room did nt have a view but was spacious and comfortable. There was a great hike rup ght behnd the garage that led to probably the best view in all of Russell. Breakfast was on the deck — and that view again! The food was delicious and there was an abundance. Our last morning, we woke to a rainbow that we could see drom our bed. I could go on and on, but this is a “must”. Go to New Zealand, spend a few days i n russell and stay at Tiki Tiki Ora   \n",
       "267401  Great Facility. Highly recommend ---SEP--- Four of us arrived tired after biking 50k of the Railtrail. The owner met us and we were efficiently installed into our pre booked rooms. The rooms were newly renovated, nicely appointed,and very roomy, with minimal modern furniture. Perfect. Our downstairs rooms opened onto a garden and large lawn, most unusual for a motel in a town, and a real gem. Although it’s close to the main road, and a little noisy outside, we really enjoyed sitting out there and even had our Thai delivered dinner there (very good food too) The garden is well below street level and so is actually quite protected from the road. Once in the room, with the doors closed, the rooms are well insulated and the road noise is minimal. I believe the owner hasn’t long been there, and we wish him every success. He was so friendly and helpful - couldn’t do enough to make our stay a pleasant one. Would go back here any day, and thoroughly recommend this motel.   \n",
