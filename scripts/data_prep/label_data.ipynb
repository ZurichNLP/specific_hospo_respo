I called about a month ahead and they only had one King Bedroom left in the main house, but they had just redone their Coachhouse on the same property so inlaws in main house, my wife and I in Coach house. King Room was the real thing, king bed, propane fireplace, spacious. only modern was bathroom which was redone but with fixtures with a traditional look. very nice. Our 'room' was a one-bedroom apt, very modern looking, open kitchen (fully equiped) king bed, 2 TVs. could have stayed a month and been quite comfortable. Breakfast was two choices which varied each morning (i.e. eggs benedict), plus a yoghurt with fruit and granola, and baked goods. Very pleasant staff who went out of their way to share local knowledge. SIMPLY NICE PEOPLE. Location was in residential area, about three blocks from the waterfront and two blocks from one of the top hundred places to eat in Canada. Staff wisely advised we reserve ahead! It was high season, At first I thought the price was high but it was the same as several other similar establishments. Our west coast inlaws thought it was excellent value. he in particular sets very high standards and could find nothing to complain about. actually he loved it! ** Check out the album in the parlour. It is a pictoral record of the renovation undertaken at the time of purchase.</td>\n",

The girls at the reception seemed rude. One asian guy was friendly. The pictures they share for the rooms around different booking sites are very misleading. I've stayed in a number of different hostels but not often (if ever) have I come across something this bad. Luckily we spent our days out on tours so we didn't have to spend more than the minimum time at our \"deluxe\"-room. The food at the Down under- bar beside the hostel was cheap and bad.

We booked a king bed (I even called to clarify), but when we arrived they put us in a room with two full size beds. When we went down to request to change, the front desk worker was extremely rude and made it sound like it was all our fault. The rooms were small and rather dingy, there are no views, no continental breakfast, and you have to pay $25 a day for parking. The beach and shopping are close by, but that was all we liked. The walls were thin and we could hear the neighbor's tv on the whole time we were there. We would not stay here again.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Aloha Kristen M - NOT IMPRESED? Sorry you had to go to such trouble to change beds - but I'm guessing we were sold out - the bedding type is on request and I'm sorry we didn't give you what you wanted. At least you liked the location but not much else. We should have offered you the parking discount for joining Wyndham Rewards - gee we even failed at that. We apologize and wish your stay had been better. Warmest Aloha, Pattie Furtado</td>\n",

I never used my key to get into the elevators, so the people who spraypainted our car could have entered the hotel. While, I understand they are not liable, they never called to apoligize, check-in, or even tell us when it happended. I called them and never received a call back. I love marriott hotels, but think the unresponsivness of this staff is unacceptable. I would be careful staying at place that doesn't care about your personal safety.</td>\n",

Had the worse nights sleep ever in a town B&amp;B, yes it’s in a town but old thinly double glazed windows that didn’t shut right and next to a busy cobbled street! It was horrendous with the added extra of someone for 30 plus minutes at 6am emptying the empty bottles from the builders trugs into whatever they where doing, we were going to check out for our second night to somewhere else but thought easier to buy some ear plugs!

A tunnel links the hotel to the terminal. From your room, you simply check out and drag your luggage through the tunnel to the departure hall. No hassles. The hotel is clean and the staff are quite friendly and helpful. Next door is the Holiday Inn which shares common elevator with Crowne Plaza. You can have the best of two worlds by also sampling the offerings in the hotel next door. Nice place!   \n",
       "2       Authentic house, authentic people ---SEP--- Stayed for two nights, my wife and I - her sister and husband who are from Vancouver. all of us approx 60. He wanted an authentic historical setting, plus king bed, etc. We have done a lot of B & B's in Maine over the years so less of an issue for us. I called about a month ahead and they only had one King Bedroom left in the main house, but they had just redone their Coachhouse on the same property so inlaws in main house, my wife and I in Coach house. King Room was the real thing, king bed, propane fireplace, spacious. only modern was bathroom which was redone but with fixtures with a traditional look. very nice. Our 'room' was a one-bedroom apt, very modern looking, open kitchen (fully equiped) king bed, 2 TVs. could have stayed a month and been quite comfortable. Breakfast was two choices which varied each morning (i.e. eggs benedict), plus a yoghurt with fruit and granola, and baked goods. Very pleasant staff who went out of their way to share local knowledge. SIMPLY NICE PEOPLE. Location was in residential area, about three blocks from the waterfront and two blocks from one of the top hundred places to eat in Canada. Staff wisely advised we reserve ahead! It was high season, At first I thought the price was high but it was the same as several other similar establishments. Our west coast inlaws thought it was excellent value. he in particular sets very high standards and could find nothing to complain about. actually he loved it! ** Check out the album in the parlour. It is a pictoral record of the renovation undertaken at the time of purchase.   \n",

The deluxe part should be changed to something more suiting, such as dumpster. There was all kinds of growths on the bathroom floors and enough fauna to fill a small zoo (spiders, lizards). The girls at the reception seemed rude. One asian guy was friendly. The pictures they share for the rooms around different booking sites are very misleading. I've stayed in a number of different hostels but not often (if ever) have I come across something this bad. Luckily we spent our days out on tours so we didn't have to spend more than the minimum time at our \"deluxe\"-room. The food at the Down under- bar beside the hostel was cheap and bad. There was a ping pong table at the lobby, which just and just justifies the one star I have to give.   \n",

Their dedication and care of this lovely old Victorian and her guests make for a wonderful stay! Culinary kudos for the breakfast - especially, the homemade muffins and bread. (I meant to try the fruit preserves.) Bright, fresh ingredients of the season are perfectly prepared and artfully served. Each guest's plate was garnished with one of my favorite flowers - a cheerful, edible nasturtium from the well-tended gardens that surround Castle Marne. Denver Botanical Gardens with its current Dale Chihuly exhibit and evening concerts was comfortably walkable for us - even with a cooler and a backpack. The off-street parking is a great convenience as is the city bus system on nearby Colfax Ave. Quiet, comfortable room. A history-filled neighborhood. There's even a porch swing.

We booked a king bed (I even called to clarify), but when we arrived they put us in a room with two full size beds. When we went down to request to change, the front desk worker was extremely rude and made it sound like it was all our fault. The rooms were small and rather dingy, there are no views, no continental breakfast, and you have to pay $25 a day for parking. The beach and shopping are close by, but that was all we liked. The walls were thin and we could hear the neighbor's tv on the whole time we were there. We would not stay here again.   \n",

The doors to the elevator from the garage were never locked. I never used my key to get into the elevators, so the people who spraypainted our car could have entered the hotel. While, I understand they are not liable, they never called to apoligize, check-in, or even tell us when it happended. I called them and never received a call back. I love marriott hotels, but think the unresponsivness of this staff is unacceptable. I would be careful staying at place that doesn't care about your personal safety.   \n",

Had the worse nights sleep ever in a town B&B, yes it’s in a town but old thinly double glazed windows that didn’t shut right and next to a busy cobbled street! It was horrendous with the added extra of someone for 30 plus minutes at 6am emptying the empty bottles from the builders trugs into whatever they where doing, we were going to check out for our second night to somewhere else but thought easier to buy some ear plugs! Unfortunately but worked! Complained in checkout but she just said we are in a town centre and there’s war plugs in the drawer??? PUT THIS ON YOUR WEBSITE THEN? Sorry and disappointed but won’t be recommending   \n",

A tunnel links the hotel to the terminal. From your room, you simply check out and drag your luggage through the tunnel to the departure hall. No hassles. The hotel is clean and the staff are quite friendly and helpful. Next door is the Holiday Inn which shares common elevator with Crowne Plaza. You can have the best of two worlds by also sampling the offerings in the hotel next door. Nice place!</td>\n",

A tunnel links the hotel to the terminal. From your room, you simply check out and drag your luggage through the tunnel to the departure hall. No hassles. The hotel is clean and the staff are quite friendly and helpful. Next door is the Holiday Inn which shares common elevator with Crowne Plaza. You can have the best of two worlds by also sampling the offerings in the hotel next door. Nice place!   \n",
       "2       Authentic house, authentic people ---SEP--- Stayed for two nights, my wife and I - her sister and husband who are from Vancouver. all of us approx 60. He wanted an authentic historical setting, plus king bed, etc. We have done a lot of B & B's in Maine over the years so less of an issue for us. I called about a month ahead and they only had one King Bedroom left in the main house, but they had just redone their Coachhouse on the same property so inlaws in main house, my wife and I in Coach house. King Room was the real thing, king bed, propane fireplace, spacious. only modern was bathroom which was redone but with fixtures with a traditional look. very nice. Our 'room' was a one-bedroom apt, very modern looking, open kitchen (fully equiped) king bed, 2 TVs. could have stayed a month and been quite comfortable. Breakfast was two choices which varied each morning (i.e. eggs benedict), plus a yoghurt with fruit and granola, and baked goods. Very pleasant staff who went out of their way to share local knowledge. SIMPLY NICE PEOPLE. Location was in residential area, about three blocks from the waterfront and two blocks from one of the top hundred places to eat in Canada. Staff wisely advised we reserve ahead! It was high season, At first I thought the price was high but it was the same as several other similar establishments. Our west coast inlaws thought it was excellent value. he in particular sets very high standards and could find nothing to complain about. actually he loved it! ** Check out the album in the parlour. It is a pictoral record of the renovation undertaken at the time of purchase.   \n",

The deluxe part should be changed to something more suiting, such as dumpster. There was all kinds of growths on the bathroom floors and enough fauna to fill a small zoo (spiders, lizards). The girls at the reception seemed rude. One asian guy was friendly. The pictures they share for the rooms around different booking sites are very misleading. I've stayed in a number of different hostels but not often (if ever) have I come across something this bad. Luckily we spent our days out on tours so we didn't have to spend more than the minimum time at our \"deluxe\"-room. The food at the Down under- bar beside the hostel was cheap and bad. There was a ping pong table at the lobby, which just and just justifies the one star I have to give.   \n",

Their dedication and care of this lovely old Victorian and her guests make for a wonderful stay! Culinary kudos for the breakfast - especially, the homemade muffins and bread. (I meant to try the fruit preserves.) Bright, fresh ingredients of the season are perfectly prepared and artfully served. Each guest's plate was garnished with one of my favorite flowers - a cheerful, edible nasturtium from the well-tended gardens that surround Castle Marne. Denver Botanical Gardens with its current Dale Chihuly exhibit and evening concerts was comfortably walkable for us - even with a cooler and a backpack. The off-street parking is a great convenience as is the city bus system on nearby Colfax Ave. Quiet, comfortable room. A history-filled neighborhood. There's even a porch swing.

We booked a king bed (I even called to clarify), but when we arrived they put us in a room with two full size beds. When we went down to request to change, the front desk worker was extremely rude and made it sound like it was all our fault. The rooms were small and rather dingy, there are no views, no continental breakfast, and you have to pay $25 a day for parking. The beach and shopping are close by, but that was all we liked. The walls were thin and we could hear the neighbor's tv on the whole time we were there. We would not stay here again.   \n",

The doors to the elevator from the garage were never locked. I never used my key to get into the elevators, so the people who spraypainted our car could have entered the hotel. While, I understand they are not liable, they never called to apoligize, check-in, or even tell us when it happended. I called them and never received a call back. I love marriott hotels, but think the unresponsivness of this staff is unacceptable. I would be careful staying at place that doesn't care about your personal safety.   \n",

Had the worse nights sleep ever in a town B&B, yes it’s in a town but old thinly double glazed windows that didn’t shut right and next to a busy cobbled street! It was horrendous with the added extra of someone for 30 plus minutes at 6am emptying the empty bottles from the builders trugs into whatever they where doing, we were going to check out for our second night to somewhere else but thought easier to buy some ear plugs! Unfortunately but worked! Complained in checkout but she just said we are in a town centre and there’s war plugs in the drawer??? PUT THIS ON YOUR WEBSITE THEN? Sorry and disappointed but won’t be recommending   \n",

We actually live in Charlotte but stayed here during a two day event uptown in Charlotte. Staff incredible detail oriented and friendly. Superior service everywhere we looked! Prices are high but you get what you okay for. It was truly a pleasure to stay at such a high quality hotel. Would recommend to everyone!  \n",

A tunnel links the hotel to the terminal. From your room, you simply check out and drag your luggage through the tunnel to the departure hall. No hassles. The hotel is clean and the staff are quite friendly and helpful. Next door is the Holiday Inn which shares common elevator with Crowne Plaza. You can have the best of two worlds by also sampling the offerings in the hotel next door. Nice place!  \n",
       "2       ppl_3: Authentic house, authentic people ---SEP--- Stayed for two nights, my wife and I - her sister and husband who are from Vancouver. all of us approx 60. He wanted an authentic historical setting, plus king bed, etc. We have done a lot of B & B's in Maine over the years so less of an issue for us. I called about a month ahead and they only had one King Bedroom left in the main house, but they had just redone their Coachhouse on the same property so inlaws in main house, my wife and I in Coach house. King Room was the real thing, king bed, propane fireplace, spacious. only modern was bathroom which was redone but with fixtures with a traditional look. very nice. Our 'room' was a one-bedroom apt, very modern looking, open kitchen (fully equiped) king bed, 2 TVs. could have stayed a month and been quite comfortable. Breakfast was two choices which varied each morning (i.e. eggs benedict), plus a yoghurt with fruit and granola, and baked goods. Very pleasant staff who went out of their way to share local knowledge. SIMPLY NICE PEOPLE. Location was in residential area, about three blocks from the waterfront and two blocks from one of the top hundred places to eat in Canada. Staff wisely advised we reserve ahead! It was high season, At first I thought the price was high but it was the same as several other similar establishments. Our west coast inlaws thought it was excellent value. he in particular sets very high standards and could find nothing to complain about. actually he loved it! ** Check out the album in the parlour. It is a pictoral record of the renovation undertaken at the time of purchase.  \n",

The deluxe part should be changed to something more suiting, such as dumpster. There was all kinds of growths on the bathroom floors and enough fauna to fill a small zoo (spiders, lizards). The girls at the reception seemed rude. One asian guy was friendly. The pictures they share for the rooms around different booking sites are very misleading. I've stayed in a number of different hostels but not often (if ever) have I come across something this bad. Luckily we spent our days out on tours so we didn't have to spend more than the minimum time at our \"deluxe\"-room. The food at the Down under- bar beside the hostel was cheap and bad. There was a ping pong table at the lobby, which just and just justifies the one star I have to give.  \n",

Their dedication and care of this lovely old Victorian and her guests make for a wonderful stay! Culinary kudos for the breakfast - especially, the homemade muffins and bread. (I meant to try the fruit preserves.) Bright, fresh ingredients of the season are perfectly prepared and artfully served. Each guest's plate was garnished with one of my favorite flowers - a cheerful, edible nasturtium from the well-tended gardens that surround Castle Marne. Denver Botanical Gardens with its current Dale Chihuly exhibit and evening concerts was comfortably walkable for us - even with a cooler and a backpack. The off-street parking is a great convenience as is the city bus system on nearby Colfax Ave. Quiet, comfortable room. A history-filled neighborhood. There's even a porch swing.

We booked a king bed (I even called to clarify), but when we arrived they put us in a room with two full size beds. When we went down to request to change, the front desk worker was extremely rude and made it sound like it was all our fault. The rooms were small and rather dingy, there are no views, no continental breakfast, and you have to pay $25 a day for parking. The beach and shopping are close by, but that was all we liked. The walls were thin and we could hear the neighbor's tv on the whole time we were there. We would not stay here again.  \n",

The doors to the elevator from the garage were never locked. I never used my key to get into the elevators, so the people who spraypainted our car could have entered the hotel. While, I understand they are not liable, they never called to apoligize, check-in, or even tell us when it happended. I called them and never received a call back. I love marriott hotels, but think the unresponsivness of this staff is unacceptable. I would be careful staying at place that doesn't care about your personal safety.  \n",

It was horrendous with the added extra of someone for 30 plus minutes at 6am emptying the empty bottles from the builders trugs into whatever they where doing, we were going to check out for our second night to somewhere else but thought easier to buy some ear plugs! Unfortunately but worked! Complained in checkout but she just said we are in a town centre and there’s war plugs in the drawer??? PUT THIS ON YOUR WEBSITE THEN? Sorry and disappointed but won’t be recommending  \n",
