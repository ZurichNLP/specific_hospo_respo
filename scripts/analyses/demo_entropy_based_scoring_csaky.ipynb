      "Great property, even better staff! ---SEP--- This review will detail the extraordinary staff we experienced at both Le Meridien and Sheraton Hotel in Charlotte. The bottom line is that they are two excellent properties with a great style, close to the convention center, and our preference in the downtown Charlotte area. Now here are the details of my weeklong stay in downtown Charlotte, where we were fortunate enough to stay at both Le Meridien and Sheraton Hotels. This was a business trip for myself, but my wife was able to join me. The property, the excellent services, and professional staff made it feel more like a vacation. The atmosphere in the lobby and the guest rooms of Le Meridien is swanky and gives the feel and look of the modern world traveler. The seating in the lobby is inviting and stylish and provides a great place to meet up or chat with fellow guests. Andrew, on check-in, was courteous and professional. Even after we checked in he called to make sure the room was suitable for our needs. Mark, the new manager who recently moved from Los Angeles went above and beyond to assist us during my stay. We had an issue with our reservation dates and Mark took it upon himself to solve it, otherwise I would had needed to change hotels. Due to my titanium elite loyalty status and our anniversary, he arranged an exquisite upgrade to a beautiful suite on the 14th floor with a living room, dining area and two full bathrooms. The décor in the suite followed the chique style of the hotel with funky seating and updated wall furnishings. Ron, the concierge manager, was attentive throughout our entire stay. He gave a personal tour of the new Le Meriden lounge which was due to open soon. Ron also surprised us with champagne and a delicious cheese plate on return after a long day. If you stay at either the Sheraton or Le Meridien, the rooftop bar and Evoke lounge are a must see/stop. The strawberry margarita was top notch. The breakfast and dinner options at Social, the downstairs Sheraton restaurant were also exceptional. The Queen City omelet is our recommendation, and the ribeye was cooked exactly as requested. The staff provided friendly and prompt service. Social provides a great late-night dinner option with delicious choices. The Sheraton club lounge in Charlotte, is by far, one of the top 5 club lounges I’ve visited in the United States. Every morning and evening Samantha and Abbey greeted us with a smile, excellent service, and appetizing food and beverage choices. Abbey provided us with great recommendations of things to see and do in Charlotte. It was obvious Abbey genuinely cares for all of her guests and ensures they have a great experience in the club lounge and during their overall stay in Charlotte. She was personable and kindhearted which are two qualities which were evident in all her interactions with her guests. Eugene, who was attending to guests in the lobby, assisted with my luggage during my stay. We had to store our bags in the lobby and he graciously assisted my wife in retrieving some personal items a couple of times. Cherish assisted me with my checkout. She greeted me with a smile and was helpful – a great representative of the service you will receive at the Sheraton Charlotte Hotel. 1.0\n",
      "THE place to stay in charlotte! ---SEP--- Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it couldn't have been better! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, great breakfast and very clean rooms! The lobby is very nice to just hang out and chill. We were in Charlotte for business and pleasure and this hotel was great for that. I would recommend this hotel for any reason you are in charlotte. It truly is the best! 1.0\n",
      "Very excellent location ---SEP--- Not a luxury hotel 4 or 5 stars as that abound in the area,but ... if this very well located and close the beach and every type of restaurant that is in the area. The room for a family of 3 or 4 people is fair and comfortable sufficiently to achieve rest after the long day on the street and being able to sleep very acceptable. Wi-Fi and breakfast, parking $10. By the way the breakfast was very complete, very well made ​​and very varied, had eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, bread, butter, fruit, juice, yogurt, milk and coffee. The price of the room per night in high season this summer, is payable, normal and acceptable for a family economy just two people. Obviously if we can recommend any doubt. 1.0\n",
      "Restaurant review ---SEP--- Ok, I only had one criticism, so let me start with that. The restaurant doesn’t accept tips via card! This was really disappointing as the service was AMAZING and we didn’t have any cash. Please fix this. Please also tell the staff working on Sunday 18th that they smashed it! Super knowledgeable, friendly, chatty but not intrusive 👌👌👌 The decor is lovely, there were a few brass miner statues that reminded me of the ones my grandad had for long service down the mines. Lovely piece of nostalgia for me. It’s very grand, but not pretentious, you could get super dolled up, or wear jeans and a rugby jersey like I did and nobody would bat an eyelid. Love that. The food was really excellent. 2 starters, roast for 2 and a bottle of wine for £61. Very reasonable for the surroundings and quality! I can’t recommend enough, we’re planning a stay in the hotel next time. Exceeded all expectations, thank you, just let us tip your wonderful staff!! 1.0\n",

He wanted an authentic historical setting, plus king bed, etc. We have done a lot of B &amp; B's in Maine over the years so less of an issue for us. I called about a month ahead and they only had one King Bedroom left in the main house, but they had just redone their Coachhouse on the same property so inlaws in main house, my wife and I in Coach house. King Room was the real thing, king bed, propane fireplace, spacious. only modern was bathroom which was redone but with fixtures with a traditional look. very nice. Our 'room' was a one-bedroom apt, very modern looking, open kitchen (fully equiped) king bed, 2 TVs. could have stayed a month and been quite comfortable. Breakfast was two choices which varied each morning (i.e. eggs benedict), plus a yoghurt with fruit and granola, and baked goods. Very pleasant staff who went out of their way to share local knowledge. SIMPLY NICE PEOPLE. Location was in residential area, about three blocks from the waterfront and two blocks from one of the top hundred places to eat in Canada. Staff wisely advised we reserve ahead! It was high season, At first I thought the price was high but it was the same as several other similar establishments. Our west coast inlaws thought it was excellent value. he in particular sets very high standards and could find nothing to complain about. actually he loved it! ** Check out the album in the parlour. It is a pictoral record of the renovation undertaken at the time of purchase.</td>\n",

Prices are high but you get what you okay for. It was truly a pleasure to stay at such a high quality hotel. Would recommend to everyone!   \n",

A tunnel links the hotel to the terminal. From your room, you simply check out and drag your luggage through the tunnel to the departure hall. No hassles. The hotel is clean and the staff are quite friendly and helpful. Next door is the Holiday Inn which shares common elevator with Crowne Plaza. You can have the best of two worlds by also sampling the offerings in the hotel next door. Nice place!   \n",
       "2  Authentic house, authentic people ---SEP--- Stayed for two nights, my wife and I - her sister and husband who are from Vancouver. all of us approx 60. He wanted an authentic historical setting, plus king bed, etc. We have done a lot of B & B's in Maine over the years so less of an issue for us. I called about a month ahead and they only had one King Bedroom left in the main house, but they had just redone their Coachhouse on the same property so inlaws in main house, my wife and I in Coach house. King Room was the real thing, king bed, propane fireplace, spacious. only modern was bathroom which was redone but with fixtures with a traditional look. very nice. Our 'room' was a one-bedroom apt, very modern looking, open kitchen (fully equiped) king bed, 2 TVs. could have stayed a month and been quite comfortable. Breakfast was two choices which varied each morning (i.e. eggs benedict), plus a yoghurt with fruit and granola, and baked goods. Very pleasant staff who went out of their way to share local knowledge. SIMPLY NICE PEOPLE. Location was in residential area, about three blocks from the waterfront and two blocks from one of the top hundred places to eat in Canada. Staff wisely advised we reserve ahead! It was high season, At first I thought the price was high but it was the same as several other similar establishments. Our west coast inlaws thought it was excellent value. he in particular sets very high standards and could find nothing to complain about. actually he loved it! ** Check out the album in the parlour. It is a pictoral record of the renovation undertaken at the time of purchase.   \n",

I am sorry to hear that you found our conference rooms to be unsuitable for people with difficulties with mobility. We do have accessibility plans in place so I am disappointed to hear that an issue arose during your stay. Please email me at gm@onekingwest.com so that I may learn more about the issues you experienced and work towards developing a solution. Again, thank you for your feedback and I hope to hear from you soon. Regards, Steve O'Brien General Manager   \n",
