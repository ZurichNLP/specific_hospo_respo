{"src_texts": "nice clean hotel with really comfy beds ---SEP--- We stayed in the corporate king room on an overnight stay in Albany. Check in was quick and easy and the staff were very friendly. Our room had been renovated and was super clean and a really decent size. I really like having the sofa to sit on and watch tv instead of having to lay on the bed. Our king size bed had nice linen and was really comfy.The new reverse cycle a/c was very efficient and kept us toasty warm. The fridge was a good size and it was great to have a microwave, kettle and toaster to use. The only slight disappointment was that the bathroom/toilet area was freezing. There is a ventilation gap in the top of the window which just made it super chilly. Free toiletries were provided and the shower had fairly good pressure and was nice and hot, though a little difficult to regulate. We had no issues with the wifi not working. Look forward to staying here next time we are in Albany and can't wait to see the finished pool area. I would highly recommend Country comfort Amity Motel", "ref_texts": "Hi Thank you taking the time to review our Motel. Your comment regarding the coolness of the bathroom was very interesting. We will experiment in replacing the glass in a few rooms to remove the gap. We want to make sure that this does not reduce the effectiveness of the ventilation fan and see if it makes a difference regarding the temperature. This gap was required when there was no fan but now as every room has a fan it may not be necessary. I hope this will be enough but we may have to look at some kind of efficient heating as well. Looking forward to having you here again when we have the pool area finished which will be by the end of September.

The breakfast buffet was well provisioned offering your standard international hotel fare. What stood out however was the quality of the service from every single staff member I encountered. Clearly the management have carefully selected the staff and then invested well in training the staff to provide first rate service across the board from check-in, to bar, to breakfast, to concierge, to check-out. Thank you! On the downside however is the speed of the internet from the room (I did not use conferencing facilities or the internet from public areas). If using the provided cable, the speed while slow, did manage to get the pages loaded. The wi-fi however struggled to load pages.

{"src_texts": "Room with a View ---SEP--- The wife and I spent 3 nights in this awesome hotel. Her parents wound up here as well and had the golf course view. We booked ahead thru The Palazzo and received what we felt like was a good deal. In fact, the lady booking our reservations encouraged my wife to call back periodically to check on a lower price...which she did...three times. Each time the room was just a little less costly so we wound up saving about a hundred dollars by the time the trip came up. Good adivce to follow! We stayed in a suite with a view (of the strip) and were on the 44th floor if memory serves. Note that we could hear the sound system some nights from what I believe was the pool even this far up. Be aware of this especially if you are rather low on this side of the hotel. The hotel was AWESOME. The bed was extrememly comfy and the room was very spacious. I loved the bathroom and my wife liked how it had a sitting area just for her for getting ready in the morning (makeup mirror/stool/storage or something). The view was AMAZING, especially at night. With binoculars we could have watched the TI show across the street (I suggest you get down there early when you are ready to watch the show - worth watching too). The fireworks that they wrap up with wind up at about the same height as the floor we were on. The living area was great too. The couch, TV, table, and large glass window showing the Vegas view made it hard to leave the hotel. It was a sunken living room type set up and was very comfortable. We took our little Keurig coffee maker as we learned that there was no coffee in the room. This turned out to be a great idea for our early morning/late night coffee needs.

{"src_texts": "Three days in Bath ---SEP--- My friend and I stayed in the Royal Hotel Bath last week. We had two nights there. We had booked a parking space, but it was not available on our arrival as the previous guests had not moved their car. This was quite quickly sorted out by the management, so we were able to park. The hotel was very nice, very clean, a little dated, but the beds were comfortable and that is what we needed after all the walking we did. My only complaint was the fact that the restaurant advertised that it took Taste Card. As I have one I thought I would use it. But no, I was not allowed to use it as I had not telephoned a booking with them. It did not matter that we checked in during the afternoon, and went to the restaurant early evening. I think this is pretty poor service. I wish now I had left the restaurant, gone round the corner and called them to book a table!! But we had a meal there, and the steak which one of us ordered was totally inedible. So all in all the visit to the restaurant was not a success! But having said that, the breakfast was fantastic. Staff were lovely, especially the reception girls. Really good.", "ref_texts": "Thank you for your review following your stay with us.

With regards to the quality of the steak I am very surprised and disappointed that you found it inedible as we are particularly proud of the quality of our meat which is supplied from a local farm with an excellent reputation and is matured for 28 days. Had you complained about the quality of the steak it would have been replaced immediately and I, therefore, regret that this resulted in you not enjoying dinner with us. However, on a positive note, I am pleased that you found breakfast to be “fantastic” and that you found our staff particularly nice.

{"src_texts": "Caution about Holiday Reservations ---SEP--- This is a lovely resort, beautiful landscaping, gorgeous beach, lots to do. We booked two ocean view rooms with two double beds in each more than five months in advance for five nights with a December 30 arrival. Our party consisted of my husband, myself, our son, daughter-in-law, and two granddaughters, ages 13 and 15. We arrived right about check-in time and quickly got to the Hilton Honors check-in counter where we were greeted by a very pleasant gentleman. He proceeded to insert all our data in the computer but ran into a snag trying to get our rooms. He sent over his supervisor who informed us that there were no rooms with two double beds available. The only rooms they could offer were king rooms on different floors and in some cases, in different towers. Since these choices were unacceptable to us, we asked to speak to her manager. Long story short, two hours later we received keys to one ocean view suite on the lowest floor of the Tapa Tower with a view into a construction pit right below and one king room on the same floor but as far away as it could be from the suite, with no view at all. The manager agreed to see if he could find acceptable rooms for us the next day, since these two rooms met none of the criteria we'd booked. The next day we were moved to two adjoining rooms, each with two double beds and ocean view in the Kalia Tower. We were satisfied with these new rooms but want to caution anyone who makes a reservation for the holiday period to be prepared to escalate when their reservation criteria are not met. It seems that a reservation merely means you'll have a room and these are distributed strictly on a first come first serve basis. We were lucky to get our requested rooms for four of the five nights but don't believe that would have happened had we not escalated to upper management. We did enjoy the continental breakfast available to Honors Gold members and were given a price break on the second room and a $100 room credit.

{"src_texts": "Modern Stay ... But Be Careful ... ---SEP--- Discovered the ultra modern Homewood Suites on River Street in Savannah via Trip Advisor. The accommodations are extremely modern with a lovely view of the river and within walking distance of the busy tourist stretch along River Street. The rooms are spacious with a separate kitchen area with a full fridge, microwave, two burner stovetop, dishwasher along with a full complement of dishes, etc. The Happy Hour with complimentary wine / beer along with a light fare for a bite was especially welcome at the day's end.

We booked in for 1, possibly 2 nights at the tail end of the Labour Day weekend.

When we called down to the desk, they said the room rate had changed and now the second night would cost $179. We then went down and spoke to the desk in person and were told the rate was now $149 as their rates fluctuate with demand, the previous day was a slow day and normally they sell out every day.

{"src_texts": "Super clean; low rates; excellent staff ---SEP--- I made reservations via the hotel's website due to the reviews read on Trip Advisor. A really clean room is often hard to find, and hotel stays normally send me home sick with allergy/sinus issues. The room was very clean, and the grounds were well maintained. I rested well each night, and we will likely return at some point in the future. If you are accustomed to higher end hotel chains, this does not have the luxury frills. You pay for what you get. If you just need a clean place to spend a few nights, this place is perfect. We ate breakfast on one day of our visit. The offerings were biscuits, sausage, gravy, waffles, cereal, some pastries, a little fruit. I wished there was yogurt. We did not try the desserts in the evenings. By 9 pm we had already crashed for the night. The flat screen tv was nice, and the room was spacious. I loved the ample HOT water, but they must have a water softener system because the soap and shampoo were hard to rinse off. The bathroom fan in our room was crazy loud. The a/c unit stopped working on our 2nd day, but the staff immediately fixed the problem. We did not use the pool.

We got a good group rate on a suite that was a good size, was very quiet, and had a nice view of the mountain. However, the 'free' wi-fi never worked which was frustrating as I had work to do. The valet parking is pretty steep and a bit annoying when you want to be able to come and go without waiting around and having to tip every time. Drinks at the lounge were good and service was fast. By far the lowest point of the hotel is the expensive Windigo restaurant which is completely overpriced. Nearly everyone in our group of about 25 were disappointed with their meals. Even though the menu sounded appealing, the food was not even mediocre, which is surprising for a 5-star hotel (it would appear this a common opinion of Fairmont Tremblant guests and so I would hope that hotel management reviews their kitchen).

Rooms are cosy and comfortable. Good quality supplies of all kinds in the room. But what I really want to mention is the customer service displayed by their staff member at reception on 19/6 morning. My colleague and I had requested a shuttle service to take us to our office ( complimentary with our corporate package). But someone else from our own company took the shuttle/car that Olsen booked for us. The lady at the reception was extremely apologetic although fault lies with those who just got into our car without a prior booking. She got us a reliable taxi driver who knew exactly where our office was and would drop us there without further delay. I was impressed by her sense of responsibility and level of customer service. This is what the hospitality industry should be all about.

{"src_texts": "Clean, good location, no resort fees ---SEP--- Me and my husband stayed here for our honeymoon (delayed by 13 years lol) and also celebrating our joint 40th birthdays. We got a free upgrade to a deluxe ocean view (booked a regular ocean view) without asking. The room was on the 11th floor, which was not high enough to see the ocean without other buildings blocking it, so I would say it was more of a partial ocean view. The room itself was spacious and very clean. Bed was comfortable. Rooms cleaned daily but they left our food tray behind one day. Hotel is very close to beach - probably a 5 minute walk. Located close to the zoo/aquarium. We walked down the strip (amazing shopping, we couldn't believe it!). Tour buses often parked across the street at the Marriott. Be careful when booking tours as they confused us with the Hyatt Regency and one tour didn't pick us up because of it, others made us go to the Mariott. So somewhat of an inconvenient location for the tours but just make sure you double and triple check when booking. The concierge desk is not visible when you walk in so be sure to ask. Breakfast was ok - they don't provide trays, you must remember to bring your tray from your room. Coffee is quite strong - selection ok regarding food, pretty typical. Big money saver. Pool is a small rectangle. Not great but I recommend spending your time at the beach anyway. Wouldn't have been a deal breaker unless we brought our kids. Cafe around the corner from the front desk offers some Starbucks items but we never got served - stood there without being acknowledged so we went elsewhere. Not the hotel's fault though. On our last day we had an early check out but a late flight. They will hold your luggage and give you a courtesy room to shower in but you must book in advance to get the time you want and you only get 30 min. We opted to pay a day rate and we were moved to a room in the other tower, it was way smaller (not a deluxe) and just had a shower. It would have been ok for a couple but that's it. All in all I would say that this hotel is better for couples or people with older kids. It's clean, economical, friendly staff, and it smells heavenly! It is a no-frills place, so if you are looking for fancy resort style, this isn't for you. However, Hawaii is expensive so I would say save your money, stay here, and spend what you saved on the tours. Thanks for a great stay and memorable vacation. We will recommend to others for sure!", "ref_texts": "Aloha beli32, Mahalo for your review. We hope you had an unforgettable honeymoon and joint birthday experience with your husband!

Our bed was super comfy and spacious. The bathroom was well appointed with a decent shower and I liked the fact that unlike some budget hotel chains, Hampton supplied us with 2 bath sheets, 2 hand / head towels and 2 flannels and complimentary toiletries. Budget hotels often sell their allegedly budget prices on the fact that they don't supply these 'luxuries' but a search on the internet revealed that we would be paying the same amount to stay at a budget chain and not have any of the 'luxuries' that the Hampton supplied. Breakfast (which was included in the price) was excellent. A good range of food and drink to cater for all tastes and very fresh. A cooked breakfast buffet was available as well as bread rolls, preserves, cereals, cold meets, cheese, pastries, tea, coffee, fruit juice and, not forgetting the waffle making machine. YUM! We filled up at breakfast and didn't need to eat out until the evening - bargain ;) The clientele were a good mixture of families, couples and business people. All of the staff were really friendly and only too happy to answer any questions we had.

Since the bedrooms are at the front then you will hear everything that goes on in the hall. Last time I stayed the bed was not very comfortable but then again they never really have been.

The staff was very nice and it is in walking distance to everything. The breakfast was decent. Cons:the bathroom was not clean. The shower was peeling and had black mildew stains. The manager ( I think ) actually came up and cleaned it himself. Yet, I still would not describe it as clean. The room, even with the windows wide open was about 90 degrees and with 100 percent humidity. I felt like I needed another shower when I stepped out of the bathroom to get dressed. I personally think that if a hotel does not have AC it should be indicated on the website. Further, it was not cheap to stay there.

Nothing was too much trouble for them and everything was done with a smile on their face, especially the young lady serving in the restaurant. The main foyer is very impressive, especially the staircase. The restaurant is niceley appointed and the menu was adequate. The food was excellent and well priced, as for a change were the drinks. The breakfast was very good but it was noted that some of the furniture in the bar area (where I had breakfast) was very tired and worn. My room was tiny and very compact.

The rooms are really well kitted out; huge bed with feather pillows, easily adjustable temperature control and all mod cons. The bathrooms are modern with a powerful shower and big bath. We had a lovely view from the room (336). The leisure facilities are second to none. The pool must be one of the most impressive in Ireland and the thermal suites really are lovely. Was in the hotel for two days and visited four times! My wife got the pregnancy treatments and loved it! The breakfast is a buffet, something I usually don't like. However, I believe Farnham provide breakfast as a buffet due to the massive selection on offer. The breakfast, dinner and two lunches that we had were of a very high standard. The staff were really nice. Not pretentious. Like in some hotels. The lads in the bar opened early so I could watch the football and stayed open late so I could watch the golf. The manager in the restaurant, a polish guy, was absolutely fantastic, he spent ages talking to us before dinner and really livened up the restaurant.

{"src_texts": "Worst hotel in the world!!! ---SEP--- Have just checked out of this hotel and only checked in a couple of hours before hand. Booked in for four nights this week but it was so so bad we decided to cut our losses and loose money rather than stay a single night there. Grossest shabbiest building iv been in for a long time. Listen to all the reviews on this website as they are all true and I wish we had listened. We're on honeymoon and it has ruined the start of it. The rooms are filthy and stenchey and when we sat on the bed it was lumpy and uneven. Requested to speak to manager and the man on the desks reply was : depends what its regarding. Think reception must get hundreds of complaints as they didn't seem surprised orbothered. Told the man we were checking out and he replied that they have 78 rooms and some have been renovated and some haven't. Well in my opinion they shouldn't put people in the non renovated rooms until the renovated ones are full which they cant be if they were able to move us. By this point I was too disgusted at the staffs attitudes that I just wanted to get out of there and I wouldn't have given them the time of day to give us another room. Honestly felt like we were in their way and they couldn't be bothered to listen. Cups in room looked unwashed, paint round windows all peeling off, toilet unflushed, we both felt like they needed help decorating rather than guests. If you have a mobility issue this is seriously not the hotel for you. Reception couldn't have been less helpful or less interested if they tried. So disgraceful that they even exist as a business and I would never ever step foot in there again even if u paid me. Awful awful awful!!!!", "ref_texts": "This review is histrionic and unhelpful as a result - more so as I was party to the dialogue with our manager.

There were a couple of things that need improvement. We found it strange that they didn't have a coffee maker in the room. With such a great view it would be nice to lounge in your room in the morning with a cup of coffee. They did provide coffee at the restaurant for take away but not until around 6:30am and you have to go get it. There was also a coffee place but it didn't open until 9:30am. The in-room dining allowed you to order a pot of coffee but that cost $17. The other thing is that there were no extra pillows and they only provided 1 hand towel which is not a big deal but it seemed a bit cheap for this type of hotel. We used the spa and it's great, the steam rooms and saunas are nice although we found 2 of the steam rooms had floors that were so hot were unable to go into them and we didn't have any shoes to wear in them.

{"src_texts": "This resort could earn 4 or 5 stars but the \"false advertising\" earned them a 2 ---SEP--- Our family of 4 booked one of the cottages for $300 a night for Thanksgiving weekend. My sister-in-law and her husband stayed in one of the lodge rooms and hoped to join us for a full turkey dinner that we planned to cook in the cottage because the resort website advertises a full kitchen. So we carefully brought our fresh turkey over in a cooler and were surprised and upset to discover that there was no oven in the \"fully equipped kitchen\". I talked to the receptionist who said \"don't talk to me, I'm only the receptionist\", but she did call the manager (Dave). Dave gave the appearance of not caring one iota about our problem. He suggested we cook the turkey on the BBQ on low heat for several hours. I thought to myself, OK, let's see if we can make that work. We went back to the unit to discover that the BBQ was very small and in no way could accommodate a turkey. Dave has clearly never cooked a turkey on one of the resort BBQs! On to plan C... check with the restaurant to see if we can pay for turkey dinner on Thanksgiving (we also asked them if they would let us use their oven - the answer was no) - reservation available only for 5:00 or after 8:00. We ended up buying some other food in the Island store and taking the turkey back home (no Thanksgiving turkey for us). We couldn't bake the cake we planned to have for dessert either. What was upsetting was the \"false advertising\" - stating that there is a full kitchen, when there is no oven, and then the completely unsympathetic response from the manager and staff at the resort. Very very disappointing customer service. For $300 a night (which in my opinion is a significant amount of money), I expect better facilities and better service. It is also unfortunate because I would have loved to give the resort a great rating. It is on beautiful Bennett Bay & our cottage had a lovely view. The cottages are nicely appointed (although showing some sign of wear). Rather than having a full washer & dryer, the owner should either install an oven (I can't image staying here for a week with no oven) or at the very least, be explicit that there is only a microwave & 4 burners.", "ref_texts": "Good review Shannon, I am sorry we messed up your thanks giving dinner getaway.

There was a wedding and a large convention going on while I was there- but you would never know. The elevators were were in the process of renovation, aside from a few short delays you would never notice. My friend actually got stuck in the elevator for about an hour- and the staff was quick to apologize and compensated him with a gift card and a nice gift in his room. It wasn't really a big deal at all- actually it was quite entertaining- but they certainly took care of him. Every single employee I interacted with was absolutely phenomenal. The food at TAMO was excellent and reasonably priced. The martinis are some of the best I have ever had. The location can't be beat- and there's always new restaurants popping up as the Seaport area grows. Bottom line: you won't be disappointed. No need to look anywhere else.

{"src_texts": "Not worth it! ---SEP--- First off, the private pool and hot tubs are FILLED with people who live in the area and aren't actual hotel guests. They need to use wrist bands! We've stayed at Turtle Bay 4 times now, and each time it has been a problem. I finally am writing a review because this time has been the worst. It's the schools fall break here locally so all the high school students, families, college kids, etc etc are in the hot tubs and pools. There isn't room for paying guests because of it. We sat there for a few hours and not once did an employee do a pool or hot tub check. Even when they do, all they ask for is a room number and people totally lie just calling out a random number. It's ridiculous. We also had a bad experience checking in. We paid for an ocean view deluxe room and were told upon check-in that all the deluxe rooms were filled, and that the hotel was really full. So, she said that they were going to offer us the next best room, at a discounted rate. Yes, they wanted US to pay for a premium room because all of their deluxe rooms were full! The concierge on our floor wasn't helpful at all. When we went to talk to her about a problem in our room she shortly told us she couldn't help and to go down to the front desk. Also, the staff at the beach started collecting all the beach chairs at 5:30 when the sign said they were available until 6:30. We were enjoying our time on the beach (we had just arrived) and a girl told us that we needed to get off the chairs because they were going to start cleaning them up at 5:30. Not worth the high price. They think they can charge high end prices here, because they are the only resort on the north shore, but it's not worth it and wayyyy overpriced.", "ref_texts": "Aloha and thank you for providing such valuable feedback.

I am sorry that you did not receive the high level of service that our staff takes such pride in providing our guests, and have forwarded your experience to my management staff.

A favorite activity is our oceanside pool, which features two hot tubs, kiddie pool and waterslide, as well as new daybeds ideally positioned to watch the crashing surf. The pool is reserved for hotel guests and I have forwarded your suggestion of guest verification to my staff. As the only resort on the North Shore, Turtle Bay Resort is the ideal spot to escape the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Within its 850 acres are 15 miles of oceanfront and mountain hiking and biking trails, on-site helipad offering helicopter tours around the island, horseback rides from the resort’s own Stables, 36 holes of championship golf, off-road Segway tours, tennis and on-site surf school instruction. All guests also have access to the Fitness Center outfitted with the latest cardiovascular equipment, use of Beats Pillbox speakers and GoPro, Hawaiian cultural lessons, daily snorkel rentals and a standup paddle clinic.

{"src_texts": "Not so nice this time! ---SEP--- As usually this time of year, we went to Mont-Tremblant for a few day in the company of some friends of ours. I made a reservation for me and my husband on my account on the Mont-Tremblant site, for a room with Queen and sofa bed. As my Mastercard was already recorded into the account I paid the advance required and printed the reservation for further use. But my friend was with me and decided to make her reservation too. So we went again in my Mont-Tremblant account, and she reserved a junior suite paying her advance with a Visa card we added to my account. And printed the reservation. Well dears!!! Never, never, never do this! Because we had a lot of troubles making sure the personnel at the hotel understand what has what and who pays what! My friend's credit card was credited with ALL the amounts! I received a junior suite and when I said I reserved a room I was told the hotel is full and we may have to move only next day. We had to cancel all activities next day because we had to give the keys at 11 but cannot enter the new room before 4pm! And guess what! I receive an other junior suite, this time it was at least a decent one, the first one had the sleeping accommodations upstairs but the main bathroom downstairs, next the salon! And of course, my final bill was at a junior suite rate, not the superior room I originally reserved. My friend and I are still in the process of making the totals, because I still have to give her a cheque with the advances she got on her credit card.

I had to stay alone on business and would thoroughly recommend this Hotel to anyone. The staff at the Surfjack were amazing. I was uncomfortable as a woman traveling by myself but it was really like having a family around so I never felt alone. The live music was wonderful, great singers and stops at 9pm so you can still sleep. The pool area was buzzing with people and music but never crowded. The staff at Mahinas were lovely and made great food and drinks. The car valets were professional but relaxed and always said hello when I got back each day. This place juggles tourists, business people, young travelers and families and creates a great experience for everyone. In short, I just loved it and wouldn't stay anywhere else now.

{"src_texts": "Wonderful service ---SEP--- I stayed with my daughter and grand daughter (baby) twice - each stay for one night. The first time we stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment on the top floor. The room had every thing we needed including 2 fridges and being at the rear of the building, noise wasn't a problem. Loved the art also. We were grateful for the fresh milk on arrival and the assistance with quite a deal of luggage up the stairs. And yes, we did enjoy happy hour with the complimentary platter. We were also given advice and assistance with the unloading and parking of the car. The second stay was in the downstairs apartment. It was much easier to transfer our luggage into this apartment. This apartment also has a washing machine. The bathroom isn't as well situated in this room as in the upstairs apartment but the sitting area is huge. The walls are quite dark. Had we not had quite so much luggage with the baby, I believe my 1st choice would have been the upstairs apartment. Reception excelled on our second stay. We discovered a problem with the hire car just before we were about to leave for the airport. Reception organised a limo with baby seat to be there in 30 mins and were happy to hold the keys until the hire car company came to collect the car we couldn't drive. Jane (?) couldn't do enough for us. Many thanks, Jane, we made our flight, no problems. The location is surrounded by restaurants and a supermarket a block away. Tram at the door. Yes there is a halfway house a block away but otherwise the area seemed fine especially during daylight hours when we were out and about. Wifi was fine.", "ref_texts": "Hello Marilyn50, We really appreciate you taking the time to write a review and add some photos. It was good you were able to stay in both of our 2 bedroom apartments during your time in Melbourne. Personally I agree with you and like the top floor suite, as it has a lot of natural light – we don’t have a lift so it is two long flights of stairs to get there but we are always happy to help with luggage. For long stays the ground floor suite may be preferable for guests wanting the laundry and full kitchen and it is a bonus that it’s easy to access, with no stairs. We were very pleased we could assist with the last minute problem with the hire car and it was really the chauffeur service we use that I have to commend for arriving quickly with the baby seat, as these can be tricky to organise. Our location in St Kilda is very convenient, as you say there is a supermarket close by and the trams at the door step enable easy access, not just to the city but some interesting areas like Brunswick St, and the South Melbourne Market. The Gatwick, on our lower side receives a lot of negative publicity, which readers of our reviews will see, but I am glad it didn’t trouble you. There’s much talk and promises about upgrades and financial assistance for it, as our State election is looming but we shall have to wait and see and hope that it improves! I am really pleased everything worked out for your trip home and we were very glad you chose to stay with us on both occasions during your trip to Victoria. We hope to see you again in the future.

On arrival, check in was smooth and staff very curteous. Was given room 406. Soon discovered this was on the road side of the hotel, which was troubled by the usual traffic noise. Overall the room was clean and tidy. Shower only in bathroom but this was a decent size. I have to say the bed was a bit soft for me, but it was clean and fresh. Decent Samsung telly with adequate range of domestic and Sky channels to choose from. Usual stuff like kettle, tea, coffee, hair dryer and adequate hanging space. Continental breakfast was included, this was ok at best. A little restricted and the \"warm\" croissants were anything but. However I'm not a big breakfast eater so I was fine with what I had. I'm sure more picky people would have struggled past the grapefruit! I didn't eat in the evening so can't comment. But I did hear one lady saying she had ordered from their evening menu and quite enjoyed what she had. Prices seemed reasonable for what they were. The location of this hotel though is excellent. 10 mins walk from Metro Centre or a minute by car. There are 3 chain and one private eateries right across the car park (and there is plenty of parking space I might add) so you shouldn't be stuck. I drove into city centre 1 night, took me 11 minutes. And you are within 2 minutes of the A1 as well so again, good location.

The trip was too busy for me to enjoy the leisure facilities but Andrew was very helpful to my husband and daughter when they visited. We had drinks and food at the hotel most evenings, with friendly and efficient bar staff, and the waiter who forgot our coffee once on a busy evening made up for it by being charming and witty. Already booked up for a short stay next August, it was really great. Lovely to see a focus on sustainability also and the Irish language being promoted, It felt like a family hotel with quiet rooms despite being Galway's biggest hotel I believe. Several coach tours on weeknights but this honestly did not get in the way of our stay at all. Plenty of parking, including some under cover that was handy as we were unlucky to have some wet days.

I do want to assure you that our breakfast room is cleaned thoroughly each day and that includes the mopping of the floor. I am very particular about keeping the breakfast room clean and ensure that it meets our high standards. As far as the breakfast quality, the bacon is very popular with the guests as we have to order several boxes each week. We don't have a stove to cook food on like a full-service hotel with a made-to-order breakfast but we don't charge for it like they do and still offer a lot of variety. I'm sorry if you felt that our staff at the front desk wasn't friendly. We do pride ourselves on that and consistently get good comments about how friendly and helpful they are. Our guest service scores over the past year (which is mainly front desk) are higher in every category than the national average for the Clarion brand.

Just by looking at the bed, one could tell that it was sagging in the middle. Obviously I was upset to see that but was too tired to go and complaint about it. Neither did I know that I could have called Booking.com and asked them to address this issue. I slept on the couch in the room and the next morning I pointed that out to the staff at the front desk. He walked over with me to the room and agreed but since the hotel was sold out couldn't do much about it. I had guranteed this with my credit card so I was concerned about looking for another place on my own as I was afraid that they would charge me for canceling so late so decided to spend another night on the couch. On the morning of the check out, when I told the staff that it seemed unreasonable to pay that kind of money for this crappy room, he simply apologized and said that I would have to take it up with Booking.com.

The interior design was contemporary and followed the chic themes of the Cullen and the Blackman. When I check into a hotel, I do expect for the room to be clean and supplied. This would include removing dirty dishes and rubbish from the previous occupants, and putting towels in the room. But mistakes do happen! So I after pre-booking a massage with Norbu (the day spa on the mezzanine level) the day prior to checking in. As I walked in four therapists were serving 1 person who was paying for waxing. All four therapists decided to ignore the two people who had just walked in and continued talking with the one customer who was leaving. At the time our appointment was supposed to start, we were finally asked 'what we were here for?' (I said to myself Óh I am fine, thank you for asking and don't worry the wait was fine). I explained we had booked in for a massage and oxygen therapy. The staff attempted to arrange some forms without immediate success and commenced searching in a frenzied and albeit incompetent manner. We were then taken through to the waiting room, which was sterile, cold and not relaxing in the slightest. We were no offered any refreshments or herbal teas and ere not given out forms. 15 minutes after our appointment was supposed to start, we were provided with out forms to fill out. After filling out our forms we were taken through to the rooms and our areas of concerns were not discussed and our forms were not even looked at! 10 minutes int my massage, I was told that my therapist needed to go out to process a payment and did so. Evening in the walk-in massage places in shopping centres had I experience such disgraceful customer service. The therapist came back in and continued my session without an apology. But the experience proceeded to get worse from there, throughout the session noises from reception filtered into the room, which made my experience the complete opposite of relaxing.I even began to twitch with anger! On completion of thhe treatment, I walked out to reception where I was told when I wanted to do my oxygen therapy as they were not available this evening. I said not to worry about it and signed the bill and to my astonishment it was the full amount o a 90 minute massage but the massage was only 60 minutes! Do you really think this many mistakes happen? Appauling service by amateurs who clearly have no education in customer service, business, marketing or hospitality. You get better service from a Formula 1 motel!", "ref_texts": "Thank you for taking the time to offer your feedback and review of our hotel.

The hotel is situated about 5 minutes drive from the centre of Galway and has lovely gardens. They also offer a pool, and Spa treatments. The food was excellent and I was with a party of 9 and asked the restaurant to book a table for us. It is obviously very popular for special occasions, a wedding during the day and 2 birthday parties in the restaurant on the Saturday evening. As usual I needed a smoking room and was given a very spacious garden room, complete with my own little walled patio with table and chairs, lovely to sit out in the sunshine. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, including giving us discount vouchers for a large shop in the city, under the same ownership as the hotel. Not being a great walker, like some of our party, we got the local bus into the city, even got a bit of a tour included, as it does not go directly, takes about 15 minutes, pleasant enough.

{"src_texts": "Do NOT Stay Here if You Value Your Belongings ---SEP--- My family and I stayed here from December 1 - December 8, 2017, our first trip ever to Honolulu. Our experiences while at the hotel were average at best and echo what many other reviewers have said: overpriced everything, elevator out of service, very small pool area, expensive beach chair rentals, etc. My review focuses, however, on what happed after we checked out on the morning of December 8th. We went straight to the airport for our flight to Maui, then proceeded directly to our hotel there. While unpacking, I realized that I had left some clothing items behind in a drawer at the Moana Surfrider, and immediately phoned to get assistance with getting them back. No more than five hours had passed. Without getting into all the details, suffice it to say that no one would take my calls, return my calls, or cared in any way about my situation or about helping me. After repeated calls over several days demanding to speak to a manager, I finally received a call on December 11th from Stephen H., who, instead of offering help or an apology, exacerbated the situation by displaying an extremely defensive attitude and suggesting that perhaps (1) I actually still had my items and just didn't realize it or (2) that TSA had removed those exact belongings (the ones I had left in the drawer) from my bag on my flight to Maui. Basically he considered anything and everything, no matter how far-fetched, as a possible explanation, while dismissing the most obvious explanation, that the person who accessed the room after we departed took them. When I insisted on filing an official report, the Moana Surfrider basically just passed me off to their insurance company and wiped their hands of the situation. Needless to say, their insurance company, First Insurance Company of Hawaii, denied my claim. Now, unless I file a police report (which in hindsight I should have done) and hire a lawyer, I have no recourse. I NEVER would have expected to be treated so poorly by any hotel, let alone one that portrays itself as a 4-star resort. Do NOT be fooled - while you will be paying luxury hotel prices, you, your belongings, and your experience during your stay are meaningless to them.", "ref_texts": "Aloha valab65, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience during your stay with us at the Moana Surfrider, the First Lady of Waikiki.

My husband and I stayed in a room with two double beds because it was cheaper than a room with a king bed which is unusual since most hotels charge the same for both styles of room. But that was okay. What was surprising for such a nice hotel was that the towels were thin and rough. I expected thicker and softer towels. Also, the bathroom lighting was poor, especially for applying makeup. I couldn't use the large mirror in the room either because the lighting in the hall was also poor.

The air conditioning unit in our room was efficient but extremely noisy and switched on and off every 5 minutes, making it difficult to sleep.

{"src_texts": "Quaint hotel, close to city centre ---SEP--- My partner and I have just returned from a lovely 3 day stay at the Westbourne Hotel and Spa. This was our first holiday together and we weren’t sure what to expect but we were completely amazed by just how luxurious this hotel was. Jamie (Hotel owner) called ahead on the morning of our arrival to check what time we would be arriving at the hotel and to make sure our room would be ready in time. The room was modern, clean and welcoming and the staff made sure we were well looked after. WiFi was available and although we had lots of facilities in the room we didn’t really spend much time in there apart from sleeping! As we were driving we had to pay £15 per day for a parking permit to park close enough to the hotel which is the only real downside... that can get quite expensive if you’re there for longer periods and there is no guarantee of a space on the street so we did have to drive into neighbouring streets to find spaces. Public transport links are excellent (the hotel is on 3 main bus routes which run as frequently as every 6 minutes) so if you can avoid using the car then please do but if, like us you want to venture out of Brighton and explore other popular tourist destinations then having the car is ideal. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the seafront & pier, a 10-15 minute walk from The Lanes and 20-25 minutes from the vibrant city centre where you will always find plenty going on. There are plenty of nice coffee shops and sandwich bars along St James Street towards town which were perfect for breakfast! We made sure we got out and about and took trips into The Lanes, Brighton’s i360 Tower, and the seafront amongst other attractions, and fully embraced the culture. Jamie was friendly, helpful and approachable and made us both feel extremely welcome. We look forward to returning again in the future!

{"src_texts": "Beautiful but food expensive and service poor. ---SEP--- We were really looking forward to staying at this stunning location especially as two family members had previously stayed and had a wonderful time, but it would appear as though a busy time, is just too much for the staff. Our accommodation was very clean and well appointed but unless you bring all your own food, you don't have any choice other than eat at the restaurant, or the Alpine Larder. Our first night the restaurant was fully booked so we went to the Larder. The service was perfunctory, with the staff member suddenly stopping with our order and talking to someone else and then raising her eyebrows and apparently we were back with our order, however nothing prepared us for the most appalling quality and the most exorbitant amount paid. The pizzas were very poor quality but the risotto was in a league of its own as it consisted of about five spoonfuls of rice and three cherry tomatoes for $24. It was a very upsetting start as there is nothing worse than no choice and totally unjustified, outrageous prices. However, our three mornings at breakfast were quite an experience as it appeared we were a real nuisance and it would have suited the staff better if we had just missed breakfast altogether. We were greeted by a sullen person, maybe the manager, who told us how busy they were and after waiting awhile we were finally seated but some of the staff were not at all friendly. This happened for the following mornings and the second morning we were asked if we had finished our breakfast and could we sit in the bar area and have our tea and coffee. We had not finished but felt pressured to move. Everyone understands about being busy and don't all resorts strive to be fully booked?

{"src_texts": "Great place to stop for a Rays game! ---SEP--- We arrived at the hotel between 3-4pm and the parking lot was pretty full, but not too far from the door no matter where you parked. The check-in staff was pleasant and very informative. There was also a coffee station set up 24 hours(free) as well as a \"pantry\" with drinks and snacks for purchase. Hotel has a lot of perks. It has close proximity to Tropicana field, right across the street. You can take a shuttle from hotel or walk a couple blocks and take catwalk over highway. When we left the game around 10:30, there was a shuttle right outside. Mon-weds, there is a 2 hour social hour in the evening. Free beer, Miller light or a local craft, or a variety of red or white wines. The night we were there, a Monday, there was mini Cuban sandwiches, roasted or fried chicken, salad bar and mini tiramisu and cookies. It was good and free! Please, if you partake, tip the staff. I noticed a lot of people didn't and they were working hard. The meal is free. The room I had was a deluxe king sweet. Furnishings were nice, bed was comfy, and it had a small kitchen with 2 burner halogen stove, microwave, full refrigerator, and a dishwasher. There was a sofa, desk, ottoman, and swivel TV. The bath had a blow dryer and any sundries normally provided. There was no in room safe and also, no usb charging ports. I have become accustomed to this at other hotels and did not bring my plug. So bring your charger if you use usb. The room was quiet and I could have slept in late, if it had not been for the children slamming the door across the hall. I know this is not the hotel's fault, but irritating. I did get a peaceful nights sleep and did not notice traffic sounds even next to highway. Breakfast was served from 7:30-9:30 on Tuesday morning, and it was again free and plenty. Beverages included Wolfgang puck coffees, 3 types juices, milk, and soft drinks. Bar included fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage, cottage cheese, baked goods, grits, biscuits & gravy, yogurt, cold cereal, waffle station, & some type of breakfast sandwich. They did clean up right at 9:30, so make sure you get down there in time. Weekends have extended breakfast. This was a great overnight stay and would be good for an extended stay.

I have limited mobility, so my husband went to the hotel to check out access, and the wonderful HR manager sorted us out with the perfect room. The bed was huge, the air conditioning was quiet, the bathroom had a big walk in shower with a choice of overhead or wall mounted spray; there was a large smart TV and all the furniture and fittings were of the highest standard. We agreed that it was the best hotel we had stayed in. It was also on the route of the brass bands and banners of the Miner’s Gala, and as we were there to attend that, this was an extra bonus.

We were supposed to be staying in a city view room, and I don't know whether we were upgraded or not but we had a partial ocean view from our balcony down to Waikiki Beach. We also had a complimentary congratulatory bottle of champagne. The room was nice and much newer than our previous accommodation. It was tidy and comfortable. Complimentary in room safe. House keeping attended and restocked daily. The front desk and concierge and tourism desk were always friendly and helpful. We also went to Dukes where we had some delicious food and drinks for lunch. We attempted to go down for dinner one night but discovered you generally need to make a reservation 2-3 days in advance so didn't end up having dinner there. It gets really busy so expect a wait if you are going to walk-in. We did hear sounds from other rooms at times...nothing too serious or prevented us from sleeping. As far as location goes, it doesn't get much better. The beach is also right on the door step. The pool was nice, though the spa usually had a questionable dirty froth in and had sand in it from all the stupid people that don't read the signs asking you to rinse off from the beach before entering but the hotel isn't to blame for that.

{"src_texts": "Great location close to city sights and shops. ---SEP--- Had a Friday night in the City to see a show. We wanted a hotel that was located within easy walking distance of the Circular Quay, Barangaroo and the centre of the city. On arrival we left our case with the concierge and explored the streets for a place to eat lunch. After a peaceful lunch, we returned to check in to our room at 2.00 pm. Not everyone books a room online like we do, so the couple checking in before us took a while to decide, but when we were finally served, it was a quick ride to the top floor in an executive room. There seemed to be a mix up with the message about my luggage, as it had not been delivered after 20 minutes, so I visited the concierge found my case and took it to the room myself. It seems they weren't really searching for it and they were surprised it wasn't in the room. Staying in a room on an executive floor is a good choice because you get a reasonable breakfast included and enough snacks and glasses of wine at night, to reduce need for a main meal and the food there was quite tasty and well presented. The room was plain but clean, and the bed was comfortable. The location is really good, so it is worth just getting you key and taking your own bag to the room, to stop any confusion. I think that any service we got was good, though the staff in the executive dining area were very efficient and friendly.

One good definition describes a Resort as “a hotel whose goal is to provide every service their customer requires or desires on site”. My definition of a Resort is “a hotel that will not aggravate you”. Based on my definition, this “place” is NOT a Resort. Both stays, after enduring a ten hour plane ride, checking in starts the aggravation. Both times I had to wait over 45 minutes to check in. This is totally unacceptable. Both times I complained, both complaints were met with “we know”. Simply put, the manager needs to be fired immediately. After checking in, you move to the elevator “rotunda”. After a few days of dealing with this idiotic innovation of modern times you will be laying in the middle of Kalakaua Avenue hoping a bus hits you. The rooms are nice, a little dated. There are two pools, both very nice. The only downside being this hotel is on the water, but NOT the beach (Waikiki Beach). When checking in, your are given a “towel” card. You exchange the “towel” card for ONE towel. At the pool, the Towel Gestapo will give you only ONE towel per card no exceptions. This also does aggravate me. Attached is a picture of the check in line. This line is LONG most of the day and evening. 70% of the problem is the hotel’s, 30% the customer’s. I watch in amazement the people who have waited patiently in line for 45 minutes. They get up to the counter and start a five minute “dance” fumbling through their luggage and purses looking for their confirmation number. I have a question for them, “WHAT WERE THEY DOING THE 45 MINUTES THEY WERE STANDING IN LINE”?? Are you stupid?? My advice is to bid on this hotel through Priceline. Wait TWO days before you plan on checking in and you will get it for $150.00 or less I can assure you with mathematical certainty. If you book this hotel and pay the going rate, you need to have your head examined.", "ref_texts": "Aloha and thank you for your recent feedback about your two stays with us.

The hotel is very modern and sleek, not like the older quaint historical buildings converted into hotels around the city. This is nice because it means bigger rooms! But minus the charm of the history, unfortunately. The terrace bar is a lot of fun and has great drinks. The rooms are very spacious which is not usual for Chicago (we had a deluxe double room) and our room offered views of both the river and the lake, so ask for one of those rooms if you care about having a view. Ours was lovely to wake up to each morning. The lobby restaurant (different than the terrace bar/restaurant) was unimpressive so we only dined there for breakfast once and ate out the other days. Loved the hotel bar in the lobby though. I did prepay for my room and had a problem with the hotel double-charging me but they were friendly and resolved the issue right away.

This hotel continues to reinforce the reason why I choose this chain. It has welcoming , polite staff and a large bright lobby, although the choice of putting some tables in there to serve tea/coffee/cake's is a mistake. I was duly upgraded but felt that the staff should have pointed out the extra complimentary's I was entitled to (small gripe)! The room was fresh, spacious and well decorated, correctly equipped although the size of the tv could have been bigger. Breakfast was fine with a good selection. However, the area is a little cramped if you have the misfortune of timing your breakfast at the same time as others. Try to get a table away from the breakfast area as I could feel the heat from the servery! The only thing that did not impress me was to pay £5 to park for the night. Total cheek as you are NOT in the city centre and the car park is NOT secured. Its quite clearly shared with Norwich FC.

We had as I'm sure you noticed a very busy weekend which involved the \"Watch Tower\" convention which was taking place at the football club next door.

Normally you'd just find comfortable sofa's within our lobby area but on this occassion as we do every year for this event we provide this facility. Breakfast was very busy as the hotel was full and everybody on the convention was on a bed and breakfast rate so we actually served over 250 breakfasts on both the Saturday and the Sunday morning. I'm really pleased you liked the rooms and found them to be clean and well decorated, the hotel is five years old now but still looks brand new a testiment to how well we all look after it! The car park is actually owned by the football club who in turn charge us for it's use, there is an attendant on duty 24 hours a day and he covers our part of the car park plus the football side of it, it is also fully covered by excellent CCTV so whilst we're not city centre £4.95 is not to bad for 24 hours of security covered parking.

All I can say is 5* in Australia is different to other places we have stayed. The leisure facilities were freezing which was a disappointment as that was one of the reasons for our choice and we couldn't use them. After highlighting this at reception we were told \"sorry we've had some maintenance done\". Should you not be advising guests this on arrival and reflecting it in your rates? There is a charge for use of credit card which you are only aware of on checking in. As we were on holiday we had no other cards. The on room movies didn't work. Apparently a storm had knocked everything out the previous day. Again, check and advise guests beforehand. One of the glasses in the room had a very large crack in in. Obviously housekeeping do not check these things. We had a superb meal at Raes, however the service was extremely poor and the manager was very rude, literally throwing a bread roll on the plate and not even asking if we'd like one. They was a low noise coming from somewhere outside of the room throughout the stay but reception weren't really interested when we highlighted this. Beautiful place to stay, but not the relaxing break we had hoped for.

We did get tapas from the bar, but the servings were tiny, particularly for what you paid. Highly recommend the pizza and cocktail night on the beach though. One little criticism I have is that the paths to the bungalows were too dark at night. They give you a torch with your keys but it didn't do much... they could put some more lights along the path.

The next day, after touring the island, our room still wasn't cleaned by 5pm, despite an army of housekeeping staff gathered in the hallway on our floor. There was one guy in a suit holding a clipboard, seemingly \"supervising\" but otherwise not lifting a finger. Union meeting, perhaps?

{"src_texts": "Perfect romantic getaway with city vibes ---SEP--- We booked a three-night stay at Clontarf Castle after it came up on a Google search for romantic getaways, and it didn’t dissapoint. A stunning hotel with a lot of character only a 20 minutes bus ride away from Dublin City Centre. The hotel looks beautiful from the outside, and as we were visiting just before christmas there were christmas lights up everywhere - heightening the atmosphere. We originally booked a so-called deluxe room, but after the “grand” welcome the atrium and reception give you, this room-type feels very «standard» and small. Apparently these rooms are the only ones identical to each other. We asked for the possibility to upgrade and the wonderful receptionist Robert Gadsby was very helpful and showed us around many different rooms, all very unique. The boutique rooms very small, but gorgeous, however, we fell for one of the junior suites on the 4th floor and Robert got us a great deal. Tip! There is one hotel room with an original featured castle wall that we really wanted to see, but it was booked out. Check if that’s available when you book, if you can! The suite came with everything you need, including a super-King bed, coffee machine, crystal glasses and a “Travel Buddy» - a smart phone you can use during your stay free of charge. WiFi is also open and very fast. Our only negative comment about the rooms would be the bathroom, that seemed very standard and identical in all the rooms we viewed. The way they have modernised the castle and converted it into a hotel is very clever and all the original features still take center stage with stylish furniture, decor and modern art creating a more modern and sophisticated feel. There is even an art trail, taking you on a self-guided tour through the hotel, viewing the hotel’s art collection. Clontarf Castle have two restaurants and a lovely bar also serving Food. The Fahrenheit Restaurant on the first floor has two rosettes, but though excellent things have been said about it, we thought the menu looked a little too standardised and decided to eat in the Centre of Town instead. However, the breakfast in Fahrenheit was excellent with Great service and a wide variety of home made breads and spreads. The Castle also does afternoon tea in the atrium Thursday to Sunday. Try get a table in the little “cave”. The hotel is situated in a nice residential area near the river and two bus routes (31 and 130) about a 5 min walk away take you in to town in 20 minutes. We loved our stay at Clontarf Castle - make sure you set aside some time just to relax there as well - three days weren’t enough for us!", "ref_texts": "Dear Monica H, On behalf of everybody here at Clontarf Castle, I would like thank you for your very kind comments regarding your experience here at Clontarf Castle.

{"src_texts": "Its just Ok - not luxurious nor quiet. ---SEP--- I lived in Dublin a number of years ago and know the city well. I have stayed in this hotel a number of times over the past 15 years and previously thought it a decent hotel. Maybe my Dubai experiences will make this review sound harsh, but I didn't really enjoy my recent stay at the Temple Bar Hotel - it seemed tired, dirty, the location means its noisy and busy (Temple Bar area)...I just was not impressed at all with the place this time around. The room was ok - the toilet facilities were 'standard' but the shower was like a drizzle of water - totally unacceptable for a hotel that purports better standards. The hallways look like they need a new coat of paint as they have marks on the walls and have seen better days. I saw many hen and stag do advertisements around the hotel - maybe this is the clientele they want to attract... Groups who don't care about the standard but just about partying...? This place will always be busy due to the location, but my advice would be... If you are a foreign national travelling with your partner or family and looking to see Dublin properly whilst staying in nice accommodation in a nice area, then you should book elsewhere. Temple Bar is a party zone... its busy and not a very clean or nice area. Yes, its good fun, but unless you want to semi-slum it, stay up around Lower Baggot Street or Merrion Square. For the purposes of the hotel, your eastern European front desk lady (sorry I didnt get her name) was superb - very friendly and an absolute gem of an employee.
