Just by looking at the bed, one could tell that it was sagging in the middle. Obviously I was upset to see that but was too tired to go and complaint about it. Neither did I know that I could have called Booking.com and asked them to address this issue. I slept on the couch in the room and the next morning I pointed that out to the staff at the front desk. He walked over with me to the room and agreed but since the hotel was sold out couldn't do much about it. I had guranteed this with my credit card so I was concerned about looking for another place on my own as I was afraid that they would charge me for canceling so late so decided to spend another night on the couch. On the morning of the check out, when I told the staff that it seemed unreasonable to pay that kind of money for this crappy room, he simply apologized and said that I would have to take it up with Booking.com.

{"src_texts": "5 star price for a 1 star stay! ---SEP--- I have stayed at all three art series hotels and after staying at the Cullen and Blackman I still wanted to give the Olsen a chance. Prior to checking-in, there was that familiar amateursim I experienced with my previous two stays at the Art Series hotels. Despite advertising valet on the website, we were told they did not offer valet. Imagine my astonishment that after parking the car temporarily, we were offered valet at check-in! But I guess mistakes do happen! After chuckling to myself at the stupidity of some businesses, I go up to the room. Very nice and quite spacious. The interior design was contemporary and followed the chic themes of the Cullen and the Blackman. When I check into a hotel, I do expect for the room to be clean and supplied. This would include removing dirty dishes and rubbish from the previous occupants, and putting towels in the room. But mistakes do happen! So I after pre-booking a massage with Norbu (the day spa on the mezzanine level) the day prior to checking in. As I walked in four therapists were serving 1 person who was paying for waxing. All four therapists decided to ignore the two people who had just walked in and continued talking with the one customer who was leaving. At the time our appointment was supposed to start, we were finally asked 'what we were here for?' (I said to myself Óh I am fine, thank you for asking and don't worry the wait was fine). I explained we had booked in for a massage and oxygen therapy. The staff attempted to arrange some forms without immediate success and commenced searching in a frenzied and albeit incompetent manner. We were then taken through to the waiting room, which was sterile, cold and not relaxing in the slightest. We were no offered any refreshments or herbal teas and ere not given out forms. 15 minutes after our appointment was supposed to start, we were provided with out forms to fill out. After filling out our forms we were taken through to the rooms and our areas of concerns were not discussed and our forms were not even looked at! 10 minutes int my massage, I was told that my therapist needed to go out to process a payment and did so. Evening in the walk-in massage places in shopping centres had I experience such disgraceful customer service. The therapist came back in and continued my session without an apology. But the experience proceeded to get worse from there, throughout the session noises from reception filtered into the room, which made my experience the complete opposite of relaxing.I even began to twitch with anger! On completion of thhe treatment, I walked out to reception where I was told when I wanted to do my oxygen therapy as they were not available this evening. I said not to worry about it and signed the bill and to my astonishment it was the full amount o a 90 minute massage but the massage was only 60 minutes!

The hotel is situated about 5 minutes drive from the centre of Galway and has lovely gardens. They also offer a pool, and Spa treatments. The food was excellent and I was with a party of 9 and asked the restaurant to book a table for us. It is obviously very popular for special occasions, a wedding during the day and 2 birthday parties in the restaurant on the Saturday evening. As usual I needed a smoking room and was given a very spacious garden room, complete with my own little walled patio with table and chairs, lovely to sit out in the sunshine. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, including giving us discount vouchers for a large shop in the city, under the same ownership as the hotel. Not being a great walker, like some of our party, we got the local bus into the city, even got a bit of a tour included, as it does not go directly, takes about 15 minutes, pleasant enough.

{"src_texts": "Do NOT Stay Here if You Value Your Belongings ---SEP--- My family and I stayed here from December 1 - December 8, 2017, our first trip ever to Honolulu. Our experiences while at the hotel were average at best and echo what many other reviewers have said: overpriced everything, elevator out of service, very small pool area, expensive beach chair rentals, etc. My review focuses, however, on what happed after we checked out on the morning of December 8th. We went straight to the airport for our flight to Maui, then proceeded directly to our hotel there. While unpacking, I realized that I had left some clothing items behind in a drawer at the Moana Surfrider, and immediately phoned to get assistance with getting them back. No more than five hours had passed. Without getting into all the details, suffice it to say that no one would take my calls, return my calls, or cared in any way about my situation or about helping me. After repeated calls over several days demanding to speak to a manager, I finally received a call on December 11th from Stephen H., who, instead of offering help or an apology, exacerbated the situation by displaying an extremely defensive attitude and suggesting that perhaps (1) I actually still had my items and just didn't realize it or (2) that TSA had removed those exact belongings (the ones I had left in the drawer) from my bag on my flight to Maui. Basically he considered anything and everything, no matter how far-fetched, as a possible explanation, while dismissing the most obvious explanation, that the person who accessed the room after we departed took them. When I insisted on filing an official report, the Moana Surfrider basically just passed me off to their insurance company and wiped their hands of the situation. Needless to say, their insurance company, First Insurance Company of Hawaii, denied my claim. Now, unless I file a police report (which in hindsight I should have done) and hire a lawyer, I have no recourse. I NEVER would have expected to be treated so poorly by any hotel, let alone one that portrays itself as a 4-star resort. Do NOT be fooled - while you will be paying luxury hotel prices, you, your belongings, and your experience during your stay are meaningless to them.", "ref_texts": "Aloha valab65, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience during your stay with us at the Moana Surfrider, the First Lady of Waikiki.

My husband and I stayed in a room with two double beds because it was cheaper than a room with a king bed which is unusual since most hotels charge the same for both styles of room. But that was okay. What was surprising for such a nice hotel was that the towels were thin and rough. I expected thicker and softer towels. Also, the bathroom lighting was poor, especially for applying makeup. I couldn't use the large mirror in the room either because the lighting in the hall was also poor.

The staff on the front desk were professional and helpful. We ordered take-out in the restaurant and were very pleased with the quality, price and timeliness of the delivery. The air conditioning unit in our room was efficient but extremely noisy and switched on and off every 5 minutes, making it difficult to sleep.

{"src_texts": "Quaint hotel, close to city centre ---SEP--- My partner and I have just returned from a lovely 3 day stay at the Westbourne Hotel and Spa. This was our first holiday together and we weren’t sure what to expect but we were completely amazed by just how luxurious this hotel was. Jamie (Hotel owner) called ahead on the morning of our arrival to check what time we would be arriving at the hotel and to make sure our room would be ready in time. The room was modern, clean and welcoming and the staff made sure we were well looked after. WiFi was available and although we had lots of facilities in the room we didn’t really spend much time in there apart from sleeping! As we were driving we had to pay £15 per day for a parking permit to park close enough to the hotel which is the only real downside... that can get quite expensive if you’re there for longer periods and there is no guarantee of a space on the street so we did have to drive into neighbouring streets to find spaces. Public transport links are excellent (the hotel is on 3 main bus routes which run as frequently as every 6 minutes) so if you can avoid using the car then please do but if, like us you want to venture out of Brighton and explore other popular tourist destinations then having the car is ideal. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the seafront & pier, a 10-15 minute walk from The Lanes and 20-25 minutes from the vibrant city centre where you will always find plenty going on. There are plenty of nice coffee shops and sandwich bars along St James Street towards town which were perfect for breakfast! We made sure we got out and about and took trips into The Lanes, Brighton’s i360 Tower, and the seafront amongst other attractions, and fully embraced the culture. Jamie was friendly, helpful and approachable and made us both feel extremely welcome. We look forward to returning again in the future!

{"src_texts": "Beautiful but food expensive and service poor. ---SEP--- We were really looking forward to staying at this stunning location especially as two family members had previously stayed and had a wonderful time, but it would appear as though a busy time, is just too much for the staff. Our accommodation was very clean and well appointed but unless you bring all your own food, you don't have any choice other than eat at the restaurant, or the Alpine Larder. Our first night the restaurant was fully booked so we went to the Larder. The service was perfunctory, with the staff member suddenly stopping with our order and talking to someone else and then raising her eyebrows and apparently we were back with our order, however nothing prepared us for the most appalling quality and the most exorbitant amount paid. The pizzas were very poor quality but the risotto was in a league of its own as it consisted of about five spoonfuls of rice and three cherry tomatoes for $24. It was a very upsetting start as there is nothing worse than no choice and totally unjustified, outrageous prices. However, our three mornings at breakfast were quite an experience as it appeared we were a real nuisance and it would have suited the staff better if we had just missed breakfast altogether. We were greeted by a sullen person, maybe the manager, who told us how busy they were and after waiting awhile we were finally seated but some of the staff were not at all friendly. This happened for the following mornings and the second morning we were asked if we had finished our breakfast and could we sit in the bar area and have our tea and coffee. We had not finished but felt pressured to move. Everyone understands about being busy and don't all resorts strive to be fully booked?

{"src_texts": "Great place to stop for a Rays game! ---SEP--- We arrived at the hotel between 3-4pm and the parking lot was pretty full, but not too far from the door no matter where you parked. The check-in staff was pleasant and very informative. There was also a coffee station set up 24 hours(free) as well as a \"pantry\" with drinks and snacks for purchase. Hotel has a lot of perks. It has close proximity to Tropicana field, right across the street. You can take a shuttle from hotel or walk a couple blocks and take catwalk over highway. When we left the game around 10:30, there was a shuttle right outside. Mon-weds, there is a 2 hour social hour in the evening. Free beer, Miller light or a local craft, or a variety of red or white wines. The night we were there, a Monday, there was mini Cuban sandwiches, roasted or fried chicken, salad bar and mini tiramisu and cookies. It was good and free! Please, if you partake, tip the staff. I noticed a lot of people didn't and they were working hard. The meal is free. The room I had was a deluxe king sweet. Furnishings were nice, bed was comfy, and it had a small kitchen with 2 burner halogen stove, microwave, full refrigerator, and a dishwasher. There was a sofa, desk, ottoman, and swivel TV. The bath had a blow dryer and any sundries normally provided. There was no in room safe and also, no usb charging ports. I have become accustomed to this at other hotels and did not bring my plug. So bring your charger if you use usb. The room was quiet and I could have slept in late, if it had not been for the children slamming the door across the hall. I know this is not the hotel's fault, but irritating. I did get a peaceful nights sleep and did not notice traffic sounds even next to highway. Breakfast was served from 7:30-9:30 on Tuesday morning, and it was again free and plenty. Beverages included Wolfgang puck coffees, 3 types juices, milk, and soft drinks. Bar included fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage, cottage cheese, baked goods, grits, biscuits & gravy, yogurt, cold cereal, waffle station, & some type of breakfast sandwich. They did clean up right at 9:30, so make sure you get down there in time. Weekends have extended breakfast. This was a great overnight stay and would be good for an extended stay.

I have limited mobility, so my husband went to the hotel to check out access, and the wonderful HR manager sorted us out with the perfect room. The bed was huge, the air conditioning was quiet, the bathroom had a big walk in shower with a choice of overhead or wall mounted spray; there was a large smart TV and all the furniture and fittings were of the highest standard. We agreed that it was the best hotel we had stayed in. It was also on the route of the brass bands and banners of the Miner’s Gala, and as we were there to attend that, this was an extra bonus. Breakfast is served in a beautiful circular room. If you book it beforehand it costs £10 each, and seemed to us to be excellent value, with a wide range of cooked and uncooked items.

We were supposed to be staying in a city view room, and I don't know whether we were upgraded or not but we had a partial ocean view from our balcony down to Waikiki Beach. We also had a complimentary congratulatory bottle of champagne. The room was nice and much newer than our previous accommodation. It was tidy and comfortable. Complimentary in room safe. House keeping attended and restocked daily. The front desk and concierge and tourism desk were always friendly and helpful. We also went to Dukes where we had some delicious food and drinks for lunch. We attempted to go down for dinner one night but discovered you generally need to make a reservation 2-3 days in advance so didn't end up having dinner there. It gets really busy so expect a wait if you are going to walk-in. We did hear sounds from other rooms at times...nothing too serious or prevented us from sleeping. As far as location goes, it doesn't get much better. The beach is also right on the door step. The pool was nice, though the spa usually had a questionable dirty froth in and had sand in it from all the stupid people that don't read the signs asking you to rinse off from the beach before entering but the hotel isn't to blame for that.

{"src_texts": "Great location close to city sights and shops. ---SEP--- Had a Friday night in the City to see a show. We wanted a hotel that was located within easy walking distance of the Circular Quay, Barangaroo and the centre of the city. On arrival we left our case with the concierge and explored the streets for a place to eat lunch. After a peaceful lunch, we returned to check in to our room at 2.00 pm. Not everyone books a room online like we do, so the couple checking in before us took a while to decide, but when we were finally served, it was a quick ride to the top floor in an executive room. There seemed to be a mix up with the message about my luggage, as it had not been delivered after 20 minutes, so I visited the concierge found my case and took it to the room myself. It seems they weren't really searching for it and they were surprised it wasn't in the room. Staying in a room on an executive floor is a good choice because you get a reasonable breakfast included and enough snacks and glasses of wine at night, to reduce need for a main meal and the food there was quite tasty and well presented. The room was plain but clean, and the bed was comfortable. The location is really good, so it is worth just getting you key and taking your own bag to the room, to stop any confusion. I think that any service we got was good, though the staff in the executive dining area were very efficient and friendly.

{"src_texts": "Did you get the number of that Bus? ---SEP--- I have stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki “Resort” TWICE this year, but certainly not by choice. I bid on a room each time using Priceline and paid only $149.00 a night as compared to the $249.00 a night going rate. With that being said, if you plan on paying the going rate of $249.00, find another hotel. One has to first analyze the definition of the word “Resort”. One good definition describes a Resort as “a hotel whose goal is to provide every service their customer requires or desires on site”. My definition of a Resort is “a hotel that will not aggravate you”. Based on my definition, this “place” is NOT a Resort. Both stays, after enduring a ten hour plane ride, checking in starts the aggravation. Both times I had to wait over 45 minutes to check in. This is totally unacceptable. Both times I complained, both complaints were met with “we know”. Simply put, the manager needs to be fired immediately. After checking in, you move to the elevator “rotunda”. After a few days of dealing with this idiotic innovation of modern times you will be laying in the middle of Kalakaua Avenue hoping a bus hits you. The rooms are nice, a little dated. There are two pools, both very nice. The only downside being this hotel is on the water, but NOT the beach (Waikiki Beach). When checking in, your are given a “towel” card. You exchange the “towel” card for ONE towel. At the pool, the Towel Gestapo will give you only ONE towel per card no exceptions. This also does aggravate me. Attached is a picture of the check in line. This line is LONG most of the day and evening. 70% of the problem is the hotel’s, 30% the customer’s. I watch in amazement the people who have waited patiently in line for 45 minutes. They get up to the counter and start a five minute “dance” fumbling through their luggage and purses looking for their confirmation number. I have a question for them, “WHAT WERE THEY DOING THE 45 MINUTES THEY WERE STANDING IN LINE”?? Are you stupid?? My advice is to bid on this hotel through Priceline. Wait TWO days before you plan on checking in and you will get it for $150.00 or less I can assure you with mathematical certainty. If you book this hotel and pay the going rate, you need to have your head examined.", "ref_texts": "Aloha and thank you for your recent feedback about your two stays with us.

The hotel is very modern and sleek, not like the older quaint historical buildings converted into hotels around the city. This is nice because it means bigger rooms!

The rooms are very spacious which is not usual for Chicago (we had a deluxe double room) and our room offered views of both the river and the lake, so ask for one of those rooms if you care about having a view. Ours was lovely to wake up to each morning. The lobby restaurant (different than the terrace bar/restaurant) was unimpressive so we only dined there for breakfast once and ate out the other days. Loved the hotel bar in the lobby though. I did prepay for my room and had a problem with the hotel double-charging me but they were friendly and resolved the issue right away.

Lawns very long & grounds generally shabby. Old car battery left at base of tree. No one noticed it. Amenities are hosed out rather than mopped so have soaking pools of water almost all the time.

This hotel continues to reinforce the reason why I choose this chain. It has welcoming , polite staff and a large bright lobby, although the choice of putting some tables in there to serve tea/coffee/cake's is a mistake. I was duly upgraded but felt that the staff should have pointed out the extra complimentary's I was entitled to (small gripe)! The room was fresh, spacious and well decorated, correctly equipped although the size of the tv could have been bigger. Breakfast was fine with a good selection. However, the area is a little cramped if you have the misfortune of timing your breakfast at the same time as others. Try to get a table away from the breakfast area as I could feel the heat from the servery! The only thing that did not impress me was to pay £5 to park for the night. Total cheek as you are NOT in the city centre and the car park is NOT secured. Its quite clearly shared with Norwich FC.

We had as I'm sure you noticed a very busy weekend which involved the \"Watch Tower\" convention which was taking place at the football club next door.

Normally you'd just find comfortable sofa's within our lobby area but on this occassion as we do every year for this event we provide this facility. Breakfast was very busy as the hotel was full and everybody on the convention was on a bed and breakfast rate so we actually served over 250 breakfasts on both the Saturday and the Sunday morning. I'm really pleased you liked the rooms and found them to be clean and well decorated, the hotel is five years old now but still looks brand new a testiment to how well we all look after it! The car park is actually owned by the football club who in turn charge us for it's use, there is an attendant on duty 24 hours a day and he covers our part of the car park plus the football side of it, it is also fully covered by excellent CCTV so whilst we're not city centre £4.95 is not to bad for 24 hours of security covered parking.

All I can say is 5* in Australia is different to other places we have stayed. The leisure facilities were freezing which was a disappointment as that was one of the reasons for our choice and we couldn't use them. After highlighting this at reception we were told \"sorry we've had some maintenance done\". Should you not be advising guests this on arrival and reflecting it in your rates? There is a charge for use of credit card which you are only aware of on checking in. As we were on holiday we had no other cards. The on room movies didn't work. Apparently a storm had knocked everything out the previous day. Again, check and advise guests beforehand. One of the glasses in the room had a very large crack in in. Obviously housekeeping do not check these things. We had a superb meal at Raes, however the service was extremely poor and the manager was very rude, literally throwing a bread roll on the plate and not even asking if we'd like one. They was a low noise coming from somewhere outside of the room throughout the stay but reception weren't really interested when we highlighted this. Beautiful place to stay, but not the relaxing break we had hoped for.

We did get tapas from the bar, but the servings were tiny, particularly for what you paid. Highly recommend the pizza and cocktail night on the beach though. One little criticism I have is that the paths to the bungalows were too dark at night. They give you a torch with your keys but it didn't do much... they could put some more lights along the path.

The renovations were clearly rushed as bare plaster and missing trim was left exposed and unfinished. On our check-in at 4:45, neither our room or several other late arrival's rooms were ready.

The next day, after touring the island, our room still wasn't cleaned by 5pm, despite an army of housekeeping staff gathered in the hallway on our floor. There was one guy in a suit holding a clipboard, seemingly \"supervising\" but otherwise not lifting a finger. Union meeting, perhaps? We went for a walk and came back to a cleaned room, if you don't count the dirty sink, smeared mirror and a drinking glass that was all smudged as though wiped with the rag used to clean the toilet.

{"src_texts": "Perfect romantic getaway with city vibes ---SEP--- We booked a three-night stay at Clontarf Castle after it came up on a Google search for romantic getaways, and it didn’t dissapoint. A stunning hotel with a lot of character only a 20 minutes bus ride away from Dublin City Centre. The hotel looks beautiful from the outside, and as we were visiting just before christmas there were christmas lights up everywhere - heightening the atmosphere. We originally booked a so-called deluxe room, but after the “grand” welcome the atrium and reception give you, this room-type feels very «standard» and small. Apparently these rooms are the only ones identical to each other. We asked for the possibility to upgrade and the wonderful receptionist Robert Gadsby was very helpful and showed us around many different rooms, all very unique. The boutique rooms very small, but gorgeous, however, we fell for one of the junior suites on the 4th floor and Robert got us a great deal. Tip! There is one hotel room with an original featured castle wall that we really wanted to see, but it was booked out. Check if that’s available when you book, if you can! The suite came with everything you need, including a super-King bed, coffee machine, crystal glasses and a “Travel Buddy» - a smart phone you can use during your stay free of charge. WiFi is also open and very fast. Our only negative comment about the rooms would be the bathroom, that seemed very standard and identical in all the rooms we viewed. The way they have modernised the castle and converted it into a hotel is very clever and all the original features still take center stage with stylish furniture, decor and modern art creating a more modern and sophisticated feel. There is even an art trail, taking you on a self-guided tour through the hotel, viewing the hotel’s art collection. Clontarf Castle have two restaurants and a lovely bar also serving Food. The Fahrenheit Restaurant on the first floor has two rosettes, but though excellent things have been said about it, we thought the menu looked a little too standardised and decided to eat in the Centre of Town instead. However, the breakfast in Fahrenheit was excellent with Great service and a wide variety of home made breads and spreads. The Castle also does afternoon tea in the atrium Thursday to Sunday. Try get a table in the little “cave”. The hotel is situated in a nice residential area near the river and two bus routes (31 and 130) about a 5 min walk away take you in to town in 20 minutes. We loved our stay at Clontarf Castle - make sure you set aside some time just to relax there as well - three days weren’t enough for us!", "ref_texts": "Dear Monica H, On behalf of everybody here at Clontarf Castle, I would like thank you for your very kind comments regarding your experience here at Clontarf Castle.

{"src_texts": "Its just Ok - not luxurious nor quiet. ---SEP--- I lived in Dublin a number of years ago and know the city well. I have stayed in this hotel a number of times over the past 15 years and previously thought it a decent hotel. Maybe my Dubai experiences will make this review sound harsh, but I didn't really enjoy my recent stay at the Temple Bar Hotel - it seemed tired, dirty, the location means its noisy and busy (Temple Bar area)...I just was not impressed at all with the place this time around. The room was ok - the toilet facilities were 'standard' but the shower was like a drizzle of water - totally unacceptable for a hotel that purports better standards. The hallways look like they need a new coat of paint as they have marks on the walls and have seen better days. I saw many hen and stag do advertisements around the hotel - maybe this is the clientele they want to attract... Groups who don't care about the standard but just about partying...? This place will always be busy due to the location, but my advice would be... If you are a foreign national travelling with your partner or family and looking to see Dublin properly whilst staying in nice accommodation in a nice area, then you should book elsewhere. Temple Bar is a party zone... its busy and not a very clean or nice area. Yes, its good fun, but unless you want to semi-slum it, stay up around Lower Baggot Street or Merrion Square.
